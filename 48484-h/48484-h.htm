<h2 class='nobreak' id='t58'>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Narrative and Lyric Poems contained in this volume
are the Second Series prescribed by the Department of
Education for examination for Junior and Senior Public
School Diplomas, and for the Senior High School Entrance,
and Entrance into the Model Schools. (Circular 58.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poems are arranged in the order in which they are
named in the prescribed list issued by the Department of
Education, and a division is made between those prescribed
for the Junior and those prescribed for the Senior examination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the annotations the chief points of difficulty have been
explained. In the case of certain poems, such as Tennyson’s
<span class='it'>Enid</span>, for example, some minor changes in words and phrases
were made in the later editions of the poet’s works. In the
cases where the later editions are still in copyright, the earlier
readings have in all cases been followed, and important
changes are indicated in the notes.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;</p>
<p class='line'>And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;</p>
<p class='line'>Beyond, red roofs about a narrow wharf</p>
<p class='line'>In cluster; then a moulder’d church; and higher</p>
<p class='line'>A long street climbs to one tall-tower’d mill;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>5</span></p>
<p class='line'>And high in heaven behind it a gray down</p>
<p class='line'>With Danish barrows; and a hazelwood,</p>
<p class='line'>By autumn nutters haunted, flourishes</p>
<p class='line'>Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Here on this beach a hundred years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>10</span></p>
<p class='line'>Three children of three houses, Annie Lee,</p>
<p class='line'>The prettiest little damsel in the port,</p>
<p class='line'>And Philip Ray the miller’s only son,</p>
<p class='line'>And Enoch Arden, a rough sailor’s lad</p>
<p class='line'>Made orphan by a winter shipwreck, play’d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>15</span></p>
<p class='line'>Among the waste and lumber of the shore,</p>
<p class='line'>Hard coils of cordage, swarthy fishing-nets,</p>
<p class='line'>Anchors of rusty fluke, and boats updrawn;</p>
<p class='line'>And built their castles of dissolving sand</p>
<p class='line'>To watch them overflow’d, or following up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>20</span></p>
<p class='line'>And flying the white breaker, daily left</p>
<p class='line'>The little footprint daily wash’d away.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A narrow cave ran in beneath the cliff:</p>
<p class='line'>In this the children play’d at keeping house.</p>
<p class='line'>Enoch was host one day, Philip the next,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>25</span></p>
<p class='line'>While Annie still was mistress; but at times</p>
<p class='line'>Enoch would hold possession for a week:</p>
<p class='line'>‘This is my house and this my little wife.’</p>
<p class='line'>‘Mine too,’ said Philip ‘turn and turn about:’</p>
<p class='line'>When, if they quarrell’d, Enoch stronger-made&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>30</span></p>
<p class='line'>Was master: then would Philip, his blue eyes</p>
<p class='line'>All flooded with the helpless wrath of tears,</p>
<p class='line'>Shriek out ‘I hate you, Enoch,’ and at this</p>
<p class='line'>The little wife would weep for company,</p>
<p class='line'>And pray them not to quarrel for her sake,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>35</span></p>
<p class='line'>And say she would be little wife to both.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But when the dawn of rosy childhood past,</p>
<p class='line'>And the new warmth of life’s ascending sun</p>
<p class='line'>Was felt by either, either fixt his heart</p>
<p class='line'>On that one girl; and Enoch spoke his love,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>40</span></p>
<p class='line'>But Philip loved in silence; and the girl</p>
<p class='line'>Seem’d kinder unto Philip than to him;</p>
<p class='line'>But she loved Enoch; tho’ she knew it not,</p>
<p class='line'>And would if asked deny it. Enoch set</p>
<p class='line'>A purpose evermore before his eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>45</span></p>
<p class='line'>To hoard all savings to the uttermost,</p>
<p class='line'>To purchase his own boat, and make a home</p>
<p class='line'>For Annie: and so prosper’d that at last</p>
<p class='line'>A luckier or a bolder fisherman,</p>
<p class='line'>A carefuller in peril, did not breathe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>50</span></p>
<p class='line'>For leagues along that breaker-beaten coast</p>
<p class='line'>Than Enoch. Likewise had he served a year</p>
<p class='line'>On board a merchantman, and made himself</p>
<p class='line'>Full sailor; and he thrice had pluck’d a life</p>
<p class='line'>From the dread sweep of the downstreaming seas:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>55</span></p>
<p class='line'>And all men look’d upon him favourably:</p>
<p class='line'>And ere he touch’d his one and-twentieth May</p>
<p class='line'>He purchased his own boat, and made a home</p>
<p class='line'>For Annie, neat and nest-like, halfway up</p>
<p class='line'>The narrow street that clamber’d toward the mill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>60</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then, on a golden autumn eventide,</p>
<p class='line'>The younger people making holiday,</p>
<p class='line'>With bag and sack and basket, great and small</p>
<p class='line'>Went nutting to the hazels. Philip stay’d</p>
<p class='line'>(His father lying sick and needing him)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>65</span></p>
<p class='line'>An hour behind; but as he climbed the hill,</p>
<p class='line'>Just where the prone edge of the wood began</p>
<p class='line'>To feather toward the hollow, saw the pair,</p>
<p class='line'>Enoch and Annie, sitting hand-in-hand,</p>
<p class='line'>His large gray eyes and weather-beaten face&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>70</span></p>
<p class='line'>All kindled by a still and sacred fire,</p>
<p class='line'>That burn’d as on an altar. Philip look’d,</p>
<p class='line'>And in their eyes and faces read his doom;</p>
<p class='line'>Then, as their faces drew together, groan’d;</p>
<p class='line'>And slipt aside, and like a wounded life&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>75</span></p>
<p class='line'>Crept down into the hollows of the wood;</p>
<p class='line'>There, while the rest were loud in merrymaking,</p>
<p class='line'>Had his dark hour unseen, and rose and past</p>
<p class='line'>Bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So these were wed, and merrily rang the bells,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>80</span></p>
<p class='line'>And merrily ran the years, seven happy years,</p>
<p class='line'>Seven happy years of health and competence,</p>
<p class='line'>And mutual love and honourable toil;</p>
<p class='line'>With children; first a daughter. In him woke,</p>
<p class='line'>With his first babe’s first cry, the noble wish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>85</span></p>
<p class='line'>To save all earnings to the uttermost,</p>
<p class='line'>And give his child a better bringing up</p>
<p class='line'>Than his had been, or hers; a wish renew’d,</p>
<p class='line'>When two years after came a boy to be</p>
<p class='line'>The rosy idol of her solitudes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>90</span></p>
<p class='line'>While Enoch was abroad on wrathful seas,</p>
<p class='line'>Or often journeying landward; for in truth</p>
<p class='line'>Enoch’s white horse, and Enoch’s ocean-spoil</p>
<p class='line'>In ocean-smelling osier and his face,</p>
<p class='line'>Rough-redden’d with a thousand winter gales,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>95</span></p>
<p class='line'>Not only to the market-cross were known,</p>
<p class='line'>But in the leafy lanes behind the down,</p>
<p class='line'>Far as the portal-warding lion-whelp,</p>
<p class='line'>And peacock-yewtree of the lonely Hall,</p>
<p class='line'>Whose Friday fare was Enoch’s ministering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>100</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then came a change, as all things human change.</p>
<p class='line'>Ten miles to northward of the narrow port</p>
<p class='line'>Open’d a larger haven: thither used</p>
<p class='line'>Enoch at times to go by land or sea;</p>
<p class='line'>And once when there, and clambering on a mast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>105</span></p>
<p class='line'>In harbour, by mischance he slipt and fell:</p>
<p class='line'>A limb was broken when they lifted him;</p>
<p class='line'>And while he lay recovering there, his wife</p>
<p class='line'>Bore him another son, a sickly one:</p>
<p class='line'>Another hand crept too across his trade&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>110</span></p>
<p class='line'>Taking her bread and theirs: and on him fell,</p>
<p class='line'>Altho’ a grave and staid God-fearing man,</p>
<p class='line'>Yet lying thus inactive, doubt and gloom.</p>
<p class='line'>He seem’d, as in a nightmare of the night,</p>
<p class='line'>To see his children leading evermore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>115</span></p>
<p class='line'>Low miserable lives of hand-to-mouth,</p>
<p class='line'>And her, he loved, a beggar: then he pray’d</p>
<p class='line'>‘Save them from this, whatever comes to me.’</p>
<p class='line'>And while he pray’d, the master of that ship</p>
<p class='line'>Enoch had served in, hearing his mischance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>120</span></p>
<p class='line'>Came, for he knew the man and valued him,</p>
<p class='line'>Reporting of his vessel China-bound,</p>
<p class='line'>And wanting yet a boatswain. Would he go?</p>
<p class='line'>There yet were many weeks before she sail’d,</p>
<p class='line'>Sail’d from this port. Would Enoch have the place?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>125</span></p>
<p class='line'>And Enoch all at once assented to it,</p>
<p class='line'>Rejoicing at that answer to his prayer.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So now that shadow of mischance appear’d</p>
<p class='line'>No graver than as when some little cloud</p>
<p class='line'>Cuts off the fiery highway of the sun,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>130</span></p>
<p class='line'>And isles a light in the offing: yet the wife—</p>
<p class='line'>When he was gone—the children—what to do?</p>
<p class='line'>Then Enoch lay long-pondering on his plans;</p>
<p class='line'>To sell the boat—and yet he loved her well—</p>
<p class='line'>How many a rough sea had he weathered in her!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>135</span></p>
<p class='line'>He knew her, as a horseman knows his horse—</p>
<p class='line'>And yet to sell her—then with what she brought</p>
<p class='line'>Buy goods and stores—set Annie forth in trade</p>
<p class='line'>With all that seamen needed or their wives—</p>
<p class='line'>So might she keep the house while he was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>140</span></p>
<p class='line'>Should he not trade himself out yonder? go</p>
<p class='line'>This voyage more than once? yea, twice or thrice—</p>
<p class='line'>As oft as needed—last, returning rich,</p>
<p class='line'>Become the master of a larger craft,</p>
<p class='line'>With fuller profits lead an easier life,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>145</span></p>
<p class='line'>Have all his pretty young ones educated,</p>
<p class='line'>And pass his days in peace among his own.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thus Enoch in his heart determined all:</p>
<p class='line'>Then moving homeward came on Annie pale,</p>
<p class='line'>Nursing the sickly babe, her latest-born.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>150</span></p>
<p class='line'>Forward she started with a happy cry,</p>
<p class='line'>And laid the feeble infant in his arms;</p>
<p class='line'>Whom Enoch took, and handled all his limbs,</p>
<p class='line'>Appraised his weight and fondled fatherlike,</p>
<p class='line'>But had no heart to break his purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>155</span></p>
<p class='line'>To Annie, till the morrow, when he spoke.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then first since Enoch’s golden ring had girt</p>
<p class='line'>Her finger, Annie fought against his will:</p>
<p class='line'>Yet not with brawling opposition she,</p>
<p class='line'>But manifold entreaties, many a tear,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>160</span></p>
<p class='line'>Many a sad kiss by day or night renew’d</p>
<p class='line'>(Sure that all evil would come out of it)</p>
<p class='line'>Besought him, supplicating, if he cared</p>
<p class='line'>For her or his dear children, not to go.</p>
<p class='line'>He not for his own self caring but her,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>165</span></p>
<p class='line'>Her and her children, let her plead in vain;</p>
<p class='line'>So grieving held his will, and bore it thro.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For Enoch parted with his old sea-friend,</p>
<p class='line'>Bought Annie goods and stores, and set his hand</p>
<p class='line'>To fit their little streetward sitting-room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>170</span></p>
<p class='line'>With shelf and corner for the goods and stores.</p>
<p class='line'>So all day long till Enoch’s last at home,</p>
<p class='line'>Shaking their pretty cabin, hammer and axe,</p>
<p class='line'>Auger and saw, while Annie seem’d to hear</p>
<p class='line'>Her own death-scaffold raising, shrill’d and rang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>175</span></p>
<p class='line'>Till this was ended, and his careful hand,—</p>
<p class='line'>The space was narrow,—having order’d all</p>
<p class='line'>Almost as neat and close as nature packs</p>
<p class='line'>Her blossom or her seedling, paused; and he,</p>
<p class='line'>Who needs would work for Annie to the last,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>180</span></p>
<p class='line'>Ascending tired, heavily slept till morn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Enoch faced this morning of farewell</p>
<p class='line'>Brightly and boldly. All his Annie’s fears,</p>
<p class='line'>Save as his Annie’s, were a laughter to him.</p>
<p class='line'>Yet Enoch as a brave God-fearing man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>185</span></p>
<p class='line'>Bow’d himself down, and in that mystery</p>
<p class='line'>Where God-in-man is one with man-in-God,</p>
<p class='line'>Pray’d for a blessing on his wife and babes</p>
<p class='line'>Whatever came to him: and then he said</p>
<p class='line'>‘Annie, this voyage by the grace of God&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>190</span></p>
<p class='line'>Will bring fair weather yet to all of us.</p>
<p class='line'>Keep a clean hearth and a clear fire for me,</p>
<p class='line'>For I’ll be back, my girl, before you know it.’</p>
<p class='line'>Then lightly rocking baby’s cradle ‘and he,</p>
<p class='line'>This pretty, puny, weakly little one,—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>195</span></p>
<p class='line'>Nay—for I love him all the better for it—</p>
<p class='line'>God bless him, he shall sit upon my knees</p>
<p class='line'>And I will tell him tales of foreign parts,</p>
<p class='line'>And make him merry, when I come home again.</p>
<p class='line'>Come Annie, come, cheer up before I go.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>200</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Him running on thus hopefully she heard,</p>
<p class='line'>And almost hoped herself; but when he turn’d</p>
<p class='line'>The current of his talk to greater things</p>
<p class='line'>In sailor fashion roughly sermonizing</p>
<p class='line'>On providence and trust in Heaven, she heard,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>205</span></p>
<p class='line'>Heard and not heard him; as the village girl,</p>
<p class='line'>Who sets her pitcher underneath the spring,</p>
<p class='line'>Musing on him that used to fill it for her,</p>
<p class='line'>Hears and not hears, and lets it overflow.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;At length she spoke ‘O Enoch, you are wise;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>210</span></p>
<p class='line'>And yet for all your wisdom well know I</p>
<p class='line'>That I shall look upon your face no more.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;‘Well then,’ said Enoch, ‘I shall look on yours.</p>
<p class='line'>Annie, the ship I sail in passes here</p>
<p class='line'>(He named the day) get you a seaman’s glass,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>215</span></p>
<p class='line'>Spy out my face, and laugh at all your fears.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But when the last of those last moments came,</p>
<p class='line'>‘Annie, my girl, cheer up, be comforted,</p>
<p class='line'>Look to the babes, and till I come again,</p>
<p class='line'>Keep everything shipshape, for I must go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>220</span></p>
<p class='line'>And fear no more for me; or if you fear</p>
<p class='line'>Cast all your cares on God; that anchor holds.</p>
<p class='line'>Is He not yonder in those uttermost</p>
<p class='line'>Parts of the morning? if I flee to these</p>
<p class='line'>Can I go from Him? and the sea is His,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>225</span></p>
<p class='line'>The sea is His: He made it.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Enoch rose,</p>
<p class='line'>Cast his strong arms about his drooping wife,</p>
<p class='line'>And kiss’d his wonder-stricken little ones;</p>
<p class='line'>But for the third, the sickly one, who slept&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>230</span></p>
<p class='line'>After a night of feverous wakefulness,</p>
<p class='line'>When Annie would have raised him Enoch said</p>
<p class='line'>‘Wake him not; let him sleep; how should the child</p>
<p class='line'>Remember this?’ and kiss’d him in his cot.</p>
<p class='line'>But Annie from her baby’s forehead clipt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>235</span></p>
<p class='line'>A tiny curl, and gave it: this he kept</p>
<p class='line'>Thro’ all his future; but now hastily caught</p>
<p class='line'>His bundle, waved his hand, and went his way.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;She, when the day, that Enoch mention’d, came,</p>
<p class='line'>Borrow’d a glass, but all in vain: perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>240</span></p>
<p class='line'>She could not fix the glass to suit her eye;</p>
<p class='line'>Perhaps her eye was dim, hand tremulous;</p>
<p class='line'>She saw him not: and while he stood on deck</p>
<p class='line'>Waving, the moment and the vessel past.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Ev’n to the last dip of the vanishing sail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>245</span></p>
<p class='line'>She watch’d it, and departed weeping for him;</p>
<p class='line'>Then, tho’ she mourned his absence as his grave,</p>
<p class='line'>Set her sad will no less to chime with his,</p>
<p class='line'>But throve not in her trade, not being bred</p>
<p class='line'>To barter, nor compensating the want&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>250</span></p>
<p class='line'>By shrewdness, neither capable of lies,</p>
<p class='line'>Nor asking overmuch and taking less,</p>
<p class='line'>And still foreboding ‘what would Enoch say?’</p>
<p class='line'>For more than once, in days of difficulty</p>
<p class='line'>And pressure, had she sold her wares for less&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>255</span></p>
<p class='line'>Than what she gave in buying what she sold:</p>
<p class='line'>She failed and sadden’d knowing it; and thus,</p>
<p class='line'>Expectant of that news which never came,</p>
<p class='line'>Gain’d for her own a scanty sustenance,</p>
<p class='line'>And lived a life of silent melancholy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>260</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Now the third child was sickly-born and grew</p>
<p class='line'>Yet sicklier, tho’ the mother cared for it</p>
<p class='line'>With all a mother’s care: nevertheless,</p>
<p class='line'>Whether her business often called her from it,</p>
<p class='line'>Or thro’ the want of what it needed most,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>265</span></p>
<p class='line'>Or means to pay the voice who best could tell</p>
<p class='line'>What most it needed—howsoe’er it was,</p>
<p class='line'>After a lingering,—ere she was aware,—</p>
<p class='line'>Like the caged bird escaping suddenly,</p>
<p class='line'>The little innocent soul flitted away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>270</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;In that same week when Annie buried it,</p>
<p class='line'>Philip’s true heart, which hunger’d for her peace</p>
<p class='line'>(Since Enoch left he had not look’d upon her),</p>
<p class='line'>Smote him, as having kept aloof so long.</p>
<p class='line'>‘Surely’ said Philip ‘I may see her now,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>275</span></p>
<p class='line'>May be some little comfort;’ therefore went,</p>
<p class='line'>Past thro’ the solitary room in front,</p>
<p class='line'>Paused for a moment at an inner door,</p>
<p class='line'>Then struck it thrice, and, no one opening,</p>
<p class='line'>Enter’d; but Annie, seated with her grief,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>280</span></p>
<p class='line'>Fresh from the burial of her little one,</p>
<p class='line'>Cared not to look on any human face,</p>
<p class='line'>But turn’d her own toward the wall and wept.</p>
<p class='line'>Then Philip standing up said falteringly</p>
<p class='line'>‘Annie, I come to ask a favour of you.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>285</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He spoke; the passion in her moan’d reply</p>
<p class='line'>‘Favour from one so sad and so forlorn</p>
<p class='line'>As I am!’ half abashed him; yet unask’d,</p>
<p class='line'>His bashfulness and tenderness at war,</p>
<p class='line'>He set himself beside her, saying to her:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>290</span></p>
<p class='line'>‘I came to speak to you of what he wished,</p>
<p class='line'>Enoch, your husband: I have ever said</p>
<p class='line'>You chose the best among us—a strong man:</p>
<p class='line'>For where he fixt his heart he set his hand</p>
<p class='line'>To do the thing he will’d, and bore it thro’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>295</span></p>
<p class='line'>And wherefore did he go this weary way,</p>
<p class='line'>And leave you lonely? not to see the world—</p>
<p class='line'>For pleasure?—nay, but for the wherewithal</p>
<p class='line'>To give his babes a better bringing-up</p>
<p class='line'>Than his had been, or yours: that was his wish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>300</span></p>
<p class='line'>And if he come again, vext will he be</p>
<p class='line'>To find the precious morning hours were lost.</p>
<p class='line'>And it would vex him even in his grave,</p>
<p class='line'>If he could know his babes were running wild</p>
<p class='line'>Like colts about the waste. So, Annie, now—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>305</span></p>
<p class='line'>Have we not known each other all our lives?</p>
<p class='line'>I do beseech you by the love you bear</p>
<p class='line'>Him and his children not to say me nay—</p>
<p class='line'>For, if you will, when Enoch comes again</p>
<p class='line'>Why then he shall repay me—if you will,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>310</span></p>
<p class='line'>Annie—for I am rich and well-to-do.</p>
<p class='line'>Now let me put the boy and girl to school:</p>
<p class='line'>This is the favour that I came to ask.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then Annie with her brows against the wall</p>
<p class='line'>Answer’d ‘I cannot look you in the face;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>315</span></p>
<p class='line'>I seem so foolish and so broken down.</p>
<p class='line'>When you came in my sorrow broke me down;</p>
<p class='line'>And now I think your kindness breaks me down;</p>
<p class='line'>But Enoch lives; that is borne in on me:</p>
<p class='line'>He will repay you: money can be repaid;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>320</span></p>
<p class='line'>Not kindness such as yours.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And Philip ask’d</p>
<p class='line'>‘Then you will let me, Annie?’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There she turn’d,</p>
<p class='line'>She rose, and fixed her swimming eyes upon him,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>325</span></p>
<p class='line'>And dwelt a moment on his kindly face,</p>
<p class='line'>Then calling down a blessing on his head</p>
<p class='line'>Caught at his hand, and wrung it passionately,</p>
<p class='line'>And past into the little garth beyond.</p>
<p class='line'>So lifted up in spirit he moved away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>330</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then Philip put the boy and girl to school,</p>
<p class='line'>And bought them needful books, and everyway,</p>
<p class='line'>Like one who does his duty by his own,</p>
<p class='line'>Made himself theirs; and tho’ for Annie’s sake,</p>
<p class='line'>Fearing the lazy gossip of the port,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>335</span></p>
<p class='line'>He oft denied his heart his dearest wish,</p>
<p class='line'>And seldom crost her threshold, yet he sent</p>
<p class='line'>Gifts by the children, garden-herbs and fruit,</p>
<p class='line'>The late and early roses from his wall,</p>
<p class='line'>Or conies from the down, and now and then,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>340</span></p>
<p class='line'>With some pretext of fineness in the meal</p>
<p class='line'>To save the offence of charitable, flour</p>
<p class='line'>From his tall mill that whistled on the waste.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But Philip did not fathom Annie’s mind:</p>
<p class='line'>Scarce could the woman when he came upon her,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>345</span></p>
<p class='line'>Out of full heart and boundless gratitude</p>
<p class='line'>Light on a broken word to thank him with.</p>
<p class='line'>But Philip was her children’s all-in-all;</p>
<p class='line'>From distant corners of the street they ran</p>
<p class='line'>To greet his hearty welcome heartily;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>350</span></p>
<p class='line'>Lords of his house and of his mill were they;</p>
<p class='line'>Worried his passive ear with petty wrongs</p>
<p class='line'>Or pleasures, hung upon him, play’d with him</p>
<p class='line'>And call’d him Father Philip. Philip gain’d</p>
<p class='line'>As Enoch lost; for Enoch seem’d to them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>355</span></p>
<p class='line'>Uncertain as a vision or a dream,</p>
<p class='line'>Faint as a figure seen in early dawn</p>
<p class='line'>Down at the far end of an avenue,</p>
<p class='line'>Going we know not where: and so ten years,</p>
<p class='line'>Since Enoch left his hearth and native land,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>360</span></p>
<p class='line'>Fled forward, and no news of Enoch came.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It chanced one evening Annie’s children long’d</p>
<p class='line'>To go with others, nutting to the wood,</p>
<p class='line'>And Annie would go with them; then they begg’d</p>
<p class='line'>For Father Philip (as they call’d him) too:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>365</span></p>
<p class='line'>Him, like the working bee in blossom-dust,</p>
<p class='line'>Blanch’d with his mill, they found; and saying to him</p>
<p class='line'>‘Come with us father Philip’ he denied;</p>
<p class='line'>But when the children pluck’d at him to go,</p>
<p class='line'>He laugh’d and yielded readily to their wish,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>370</span></p>
<p class='line'>For was not Annie with them? and they went.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But after scaling half the weary down,</p>
<p class='line'>Just where the prone edge of the wood began</p>
<p class='line'>To feather toward the hollow, all her force</p>
<p class='line'>Fail’d her; and sighing ‘Let me rest’ she said;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>375</span></p>
<p class='line'>So Philip rested with her well-content;</p>
<p class='line'>While all the younger ones with jubilant cries</p>
<p class='line'>Broke from their elders, and tumultuously</p>
<p class='line'>Down thro’ the whitening hazels made a plunge</p>
<p class='line'>To the bottom, and dispersed, and bent or broke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>380</span></p>
<p class='line'>The lithe reluctant boughs to tear away</p>
<p class='line'>Their tawny clusters, crying to each other</p>
<p class='line'>And calling, here and there, about the wood.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But Philip sitting at her side forgot</p>
<p class='line'>Her presence, and remember’d one dark hour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>385</span></p>
<p class='line'>Here in this wood, when like a wounded life</p>
<p class='line'>He crept into the shadow: at last he said</p>
<p class='line'>Lifting his honest forehead, ‘Listen, Annie,</p>
<p class='line'>How merry they are down yonder in the wood.’</p>
<p class='line'>‘Tired, Annie?’ for she did not speak a word.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>390</span></p>
<p class='line'>‘Tired?’ but her face had fallen upon her hands;</p>
<p class='line'>At which as with a kind of anger in him,</p>
<p class='line'>‘The ship was lost,’ he said, ‘the ship was lost!</p>
<p class='line'>No more of that! why should you kill yourself</p>
<p class='line'>And make them orphans quite?’ And Annie said&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>395</span></p>
<p class='line'>‘I thought not of it: but—I know not why—</p>
<p class='line'>Their voices make me feel so solitary.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then Philip coming somewhat closer spoke.</p>
<p class='line'>‘Annie, there is a thing upon my mind,</p>
<p class='line'>And it has been upon my mind so long,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>400</span></p>
<p class='line'>That tho’ I know not when it first came there,</p>
<p class='line'>I know that it will out at last. O Annie,</p>
<p class='line'>It is beyond all hope, against all chance,</p>
<p class='line'>That he who left you ten long years ago</p>
<p class='line'>Should still be living; well then—let me speak:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>405</span></p>
<p class='line'>I grieve to see you poor and wanting help:</p>
<p class='line'>I cannot help you as I wish to do</p>
<p class='line'>Unless—they say that women are so quick—</p>
<p class='line'>Perhaps you know what I would have you know—</p>
<p class='line'>I wish you for my wife. I fain would prove&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>410</span></p>
<p class='line'>A father to your children: I do think</p>
<p class='line'>They love me as a father: I am sure</p>
<p class='line'>That I love them as if they were mine own;</p>
<p class='line'>And I believe, if you were fast my wife,</p>
<p class='line'>That after all these sad uncertain years,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>415</span></p>
<p class='line'>We might be still as happy as God grants</p>
<p class='line'>To any of His creatures. Think upon it:</p>
<p class='line'>For I am well-to-do—no kin, no care,</p>
<p class='line'>No burthen, save my care for you and yours:</p>
<p class='line'>And we have known each other all our lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>420</span></p>
<p class='line'>And I have loved you longer than you know.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then answer’d Annie; tenderly she spoke:</p>
<p class='line'>‘You have been as God’s good angel in our house.</p>
<p class='line'>God bless you for it, God reward you for it,</p>
<p class='line'>Philip, with something happier than myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>425</span></p>
<p class='line'>Can one love twice? can you be ever loved</p>
<p class='line'>As Enoch was? what is it that you ask?’</p>
<p class='line'>‘I am content’ he answer’d ‘to be loved</p>
<p class='line'>A little after Enoch.’ ‘O’ she cried</p>
<p class='line'>Scared as it were ‘dear Philip, wait a while:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>430</span></p>
<p class='line'>If Enoch comes—but Enoch will not come—</p>
<p class='line'>Yet wait a year, a year is not so long:</p>
<p class='line'>Surely I shall be wiser in a year:</p>
<p class='line'>O wait a little!’ Philip sadly said</p>
<p class='line'>‘Annie, as I have waited all my life&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>435</span></p>
<p class='line'>I well may wait a little.’ ‘Nay’ she cried</p>
<p class='line'>‘I am bound: you have my promise—in a year:</p>
<p class='line'>Will you not bide your year as I bide mine?’</p>
<p class='line'>And Philip answer’d ‘I will bide my year.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Here both were mute, till Philip glancing up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>440</span></p>
<p class='line'>Beheld the dead flame of the fallen day</p>
<p class='line'>Pass from the Danish barrow overhead;</p>
<p class='line'>Then fearing night and chill for Annie, rose</p>
<p class='line'>And sent his voice beneath him thro’ the wood.</p>
<p class='line'>Up came the children laden with their spoil;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>445</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then all descended to the port, and there</p>
<p class='line'>At Annie’s door he paused and gave his hand,</p>
<p class='line'>Saying gently ‘Annie, when I spoke to you,</p>
<p class='line'>That was your hour of weakness. I was wrong.</p>
<p class='line'>I am always bound to you, but you are free.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>450</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then Annie weeping answer’d ‘I am bound.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;She spoke; and in one moment as it were,</p>
<p class='line'>While yet she went about her household ways,</p>
<p class='line'>Ev’n as she dwelt upon his latest words,</p>
<p class='line'>That he had lov’d her longer than she knew,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>455</span></p>
<p class='line'>That autumn into autumn flash’d again,</p>
<p class='line'>And there he stood once more before her face,</p>
<p class='line'>Claiming her promise. ‘Is it a year?’ she ask’d.</p>
<p class='line'>‘Yes, if the nuts’ he said ‘be ripe again:</p>
<p class='line'>Come out and see.’ But she—she put him off—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>460</span></p>
<p class='line'>So much to look to—such a change—a month—</p>
<p class='line'>Give her a month—she knew that she was bound—</p>
<p class='line'>A month—no more. Then Philip with his eyes</p>
<p class='line'>Full of that lifelong hunger, and his voice</p>
<p class='line'>Shaking a little like a drunkard’s hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>465</span></p>
<p class='line'>‘Take your own time, Annie, take your own time.’</p>
<p class='line'>And Annie could have wept for pity of him;</p>
<p class='line'>And yet she held him on delayingly</p>
<p class='line'>With many a scarce-believable excuse,</p>
<p class='line'>Trying his truth and his long-sufferance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>470</span></p>
<p class='line'>Till half-another year had slipped away.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;By this the lazy gossips of the port,</p>
<p class='line'>Abhorrent of a calculation crost</p>
<p class='line'>Began to chafe as at a personal wrong.</p>
<p class='line'>Some thought that Philip did but trifle with her;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>475</span></p>
<p class='line'>Some that she but held off to draw him on;</p>
<p class='line'>And others laugh’d at her and Philip too,</p>
<p class='line'>As simple folk that knew not their own minds;</p>
<p class='line'>And one, in whom all evil fancies clung</p>
<p class='line'>Like serpent eggs together, laughingly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>480</span></p>
<p class='line'>Would hint at worse in either. Her own son</p>
<p class='line'>Was silent, tho’ he often look’d his wish;</p>
<p class='line'>But evermore the daughter prest upon her</p>
<p class='line'>To wed the man so dear to all of them</p>
<p class='line'>And lift the household out of poverty;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>485</span></p>
<p class='line'>And Philip’s rosy face contracting grew</p>
<p class='line'>Careworn and wan; and all these things fell on her</p>
<p class='line'>Sharp as reproach.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;At last one night it chanced</p>
<p class='line'>That Annie could not sleep, but earnestly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>490</span></p>
<p class='line'>Pray’d for a sign ‘my Enoch is he gone?’</p>
<p class='line'>Then compass’d round by the blind wall of night</p>
<p class='line'>Brook’d not the expectant terror of her heart,</p>
<p class='line'>Started from bed, and struck herself a light,</p>
<p class='line'>Then desperately seized the holy Book,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>495</span></p>
<p class='line'>Suddenly set it wide to find a sign,</p>
<p class='line'>Suddenly put her finger on the text,</p>
<p class='line'>‘Under a palmtree.’ That was nothing to her:</p>
<p class='line'>No meaning there: she closed the Book and slept:</p>
<p class='line'>When lo! her Enoch sitting on a height,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>500</span></p>
<p class='line'>Under a palmtree, over him the Sun:</p>
<p class='line'>‘He is gone,’ she thought, ‘he is happy, he is singing</p>
<p class='line'>Hosanna in the highest: yonder shines</p>
<p class='line'>The Sun of Righteousness, and these be palms</p>
<p class='line'>Whereof the happy people strowing cried&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>505</span></p>
<p class='line'>“Hosanna in the highest!”’ Here she woke,</p>
<p class='line'>Resolved, sent for him and said wildly to him</p>
<p class='line'>‘There is no reason why we should not wed.’</p>
<p class='line'>‘Then for God’s sake,’ he answer’d, ‘both our sakes,</p>
<p class='line'>So you will wed me, let it be at once.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>510</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So these were wed and merrily rang the bells,</p>
<p class='line'>Merrily rang the bells and they were wed.</p>
<p class='line'>But never merrily beat Annie’s heart.</p>
<p class='line'>A footstep seem’d to fall beside her path,</p>
<p class='line'>She knew not whence; a whisper on her ear,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>515</span></p>
<p class='line'>She knew not what; nor loved she to be left</p>
<p class='line'>Alone at home nor ventured out alone.</p>
<p class='line'>What ail’d her then, that ere she enter’d, often</p>
<p class='line'>Her hand dwelt lingeringly on the latch,</p>
<p class='line'>Fearing to enter: Philip thought he knew:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>520</span></p>
<p class='line'>Such doubts and fears were common to her state,</p>
<p class='line'>Being with child: but when her child was born,</p>
<p class='line'>Then her new child was as herself renew’d,</p>
<p class='line'>Then the new mother came about her heart,</p>
<p class='line'>Then her good Philip was her all-in-all,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>525</span></p>
<p class='line'>And that mysterious instinct wholly died.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And where was Enoch? prosperously sail’d</p>
<p class='line'>The ship ‘Good Fortune,’ tho’ at setting forth</p>
<p class='line'>The Biscay, roughly ridging eastward, shook</p>
<p class='line'>And almost overwhelm’d her, yet unvext&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>530</span></p>
<p class='line'>She slipt across the summer of the world,</p>
<p class='line'>Then after a long tumble about the Cape</p>
<p class='line'>And frequent interchange of foul and fair,</p>
<p class='line'>She passing thro’ the summer world again,</p>
<p class='line'>The breath of heaven came continually&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>535</span></p>
<p class='line'>And sent her sweetly by the golden isles,</p>
<p class='line'>Till silent in her oriental haven.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;There Enoch traded for himself, and bought</p>
<p class='line'>Quaint monsters for the market of those times,</p>
<p class='line'>A gilded dragon also for the babes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>540</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Less lucky her home-voyage: at first indeed</p>
<p class='line'>Thro’ many a fair sea-circle, day by day,</p>
<p class='line'>Scarce-rocking, her full-busted figure-head</p>
<p class='line'>Stared o’er the ripple feathering from her bows:</p>
<p class='line'>Then follow’d calms, and then winds variable,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>545</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then baffling, a long course of them; and last</p>
<p class='line'>Storm, such as drove her under moonless heavens</p>
<p class='line'>Till hard upon the cry of ‘breakers’ came</p>
<p class='line'>The crash of ruin, and the loss of all</p>
<p class='line'>But Enoch and two others. Half the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>550</span></p>
<p class='line'>Buoy’d upon floating tackle and broken spars,</p>
<p class='line'>These drifted, stranding on an isle at morn</p>
<p class='line'>Rich, but the loneliest in a lonely sea.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;No want was there of human sustenance,</p>
<p class='line'>Soft fruitage, mighty nuts, and nourishing roots;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>555</span></p>
<p class='line'>Nor save for pity was it hard to take</p>
<p class='line'>The helpless life so wild that it was tame.</p>
<p class='line'>There in a seaward-gazing mountain-gorge</p>
<p class='line'>They built, and thatch’d with leaves of palm, a hut,</p>
<p class='line'>Half hut, half native cavern. So the three,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>560</span></p>
<p class='line'>Set in this Eden of all plenteousness,</p>
<p class='line'>Dwelt with eternal summer, ill-content.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For one, the youngest, hardly more than boy,</p>
<p class='line'>Hurt in that night of sudden ruin and wreck,</p>
<p class='line'>Lay lingering out a three years’ death-in-life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>565</span></p>
<p class='line'>They could not leave him. After he was gone,</p>
<p class='line'>The two remaining found a fallen stem;</p>
<p class='line'>And Enoch’s comrade, careless of himself,</p>
<p class='line'>Fire-hollowing this in Indian fashion, fell</p>
<p class='line'>Sun-stricken, and that other lived alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>570</span></p>
<p class='line'>In those two deaths he read God’s warning ‘wait.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns</p>
<p class='line'>And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,</p>
<p class='line'>The slender coco’s drooping crown of plumes,</p>
<p class='line'>The lightning flash of insect and of bird,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>575</span></p>
<p class='line'>The lustre of the long convolvuluses</p>
<p class='line'>That coil’d around the stately stems, and ran</p>
<p class='line'>Ev’n to the limit of the land, the glows</p>
<p class='line'>And glories of the broad belt of the world,</p>
<p class='line'>All these he saw; but what he fain had seen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>580</span></p>
<p class='line'>He could not see, the kindly human face,</p>
<p class='line'>Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard</p>
<p class='line'>The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,</p>
<p class='line'>The league-long roller thundering on the reef,</p>
<p class='line'>The moving whisper of huge trees that branch’d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>585</span></p>
<p class='line'>And blossom’d in the zenith, or the sweep</p>
<p class='line'>Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,</p>
<p class='line'>As down the shore he ranged, or all day long</p>
<p class='line'>Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,</p>
<p class='line'>A shipwreck’d sailor, waiting for a sail:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>590</span></p>
<p class='line'>No sail from day to day, but every day</p>
<p class='line'>The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts</p>
<p class='line'>Among the palms and ferns and precipices;</p>
<p class='line'>The blaze upon the waters to the east;</p>
<p class='line'>The blaze upon his island overhead;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>595</span></p>
<p class='line'>The blaze upon the waters to the west;</p>
<p class='line'>Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,</p>
<p class='line'>The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again</p>
<p class='line'>The scarlet shafts of sunrise—but no sail.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;There often as he watch’d or seem’d to watch,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>600</span></p>
<p class='line'>So still, the golden lizard on him paused,</p>
<p class='line'>A phantom made of many phantoms moved</p>
<p class='line'>Before him haunting him, or he himself</p>
<p class='line'>Moved haunting people, things and places, known</p>
<p class='line'>Far in a darker isle beyond the line;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>605</span></p>
<p class='line'>The babes, their babble, Annie, the small house,</p>
<p class='line'>The climbing street, the mill, the leafy lanes,</p>
<p class='line'>The peacock-yewtree and the lonely Hall,</p>
<p class='line'>The horse he drove, the boat he sold, the chill</p>
<p class='line'>November dawns and dewy-glooming downs,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>610</span></p>
<p class='line'>The gentle shower, the smell of dying leaves,</p>
<p class='line'>And the low moan of leaden-colour’d seas.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Once likewise, in the ringing of his ears,</p>
<p class='line'>Tho’ faintly, merrily—far and far away—</p>
<p class='line'>He heard the pealing of his parish bells;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>615</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then, tho’ he knew not wherefore, started up</p>
<p class='line'>Shuddering, and when the beauteous hateful isle</p>
<p class='line'>Return’d upon him, had not his poor heart</p>
<p class='line'>Spoken with That, which being everywhere</p>
<p class='line'>Lets none, who speaks with Him, seem all alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>620</span></p>
<p class='line'>Surely the man had died of solitude.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thus over Enoch’s early-silvering head</p>
<p class='line'>The sunny and rainy seasons came and went</p>
<p class='line'>Year after year. His hopes to see his own,</p>
<p class='line'>And pace the sacred old familiar fields,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>625</span></p>
<p class='line'>Not yet had perished, when his lonely doom</p>
<p class='line'>Came suddenly to an end. Another ship</p>
<p class='line'>(She wanted water) blown by baffling winds,</p>
<p class='line'>Like the Good Fortune, from her destined course,</p>
<p class='line'>Stay’d by this isle, not knowing where she lay:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>630</span></p>
<p class='line'>For since the mate had seen at early dawn</p>
<p class='line'>Across a break on the mist-wreathen isle</p>
<p class='line'>The silent water slipping from the hills,</p>
<p class='line'>They sent a crew that landing burst away</p>
<p class='line'>In search of stream or fount, and fill’d the shores&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>635</span></p>
<p class='line'>With clamour. Downward from his mountain gorge</p>
<p class='line'>Stept the long-hair’d, long-bearded solitary,</p>
<p class='line'>Brown, looking hardly human, strangely clad,</p>
<p class='line'>Muttering and mumbling, idiotlike it seem’d,</p>
<p class='line'>With inarticulate rage, and making signs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>640</span></p>
<p class='line'>They knew not what: and yet he led the way</p>
<p class='line'>To where the rivulets of sweet water ran;</p>
<p class='line'>And ever as he mingled with the crew,</p>
<p class='line'>And heard them talking, his long-bounden tongue</p>
<p class='line'>Was loosen’d, till he made them understand;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>645</span></p>
<p class='line'>Whom, when their casks were fill’d they took aboard:</p>
<p class='line'>And there the tale he utter’d brokenly,</p>
<p class='line'>Scarce credited at first but more and more,</p>
<p class='line'>Amazed and melted all who listen’d to it:</p>
<p class='line'>And clothes they gave him and free passage home;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>650</span></p>
<p class='line'>But oft he work’d among the rest and shook</p>
<p class='line'>His isolation from him. None of these</p>
<p class='line'>Came from his county, or could answer him,</p>
<p class='line'>If question’d, aught of what he cared to know.</p>
<p class='line'>And dull the voyage was with long delays,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>655</span></p>
<p class='line'>The vessel scarce sea-worthy; but evermore</p>
<p class='line'>His fancy fled before the lazy wind</p>
<p class='line'>Returning, till beneath a clouded moon</p>
<p class='line'>He like a lover down thro’ all his blood</p>
<p class='line'>Drew in the dewy meadowy morning-breath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>660</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of England, blown across her ghostly wall:</p>
<p class='line'>And that same morning officers and men</p>
<p class='line'>Levied a kindly tax upon themselves,</p>
<p class='line'>Pitying the lonely man and gave him it:</p>
<p class='line'>Then moving up the coast they landed him,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>665</span></p>
<p class='line'>Ev’n in that harbour whence he sail’d before.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;There Enoch spoke no word to anyone,</p>
<p class='line'>But homeward—home—what home? had he a home?</p>
<p class='line'>His home, he walk’d. Bright was that afternoon,</p>
<p class='line'>Sunny but chill; till drawn thro’ either chasm,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>670</span></p>
<p class='line'>Where either haven open’d on the deeps,</p>
<p class='line'>Roll’d a sea-haze and whelm’d the world in gray;</p>
<p class='line'>Cut off the length of highway on before,</p>
<p class='line'>And left but narrow breadth to left and right</p>
<p class='line'>Of wither’d holt or tilth or pasturage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>675</span></p>
<p class='line'>On the nigh-naked tree the robin piped</p>
<p class='line'>Disconsolate, and thro’ the dripping haze</p>
<p class='line'>The dead weight of the dead leaf bore it down:</p>
<p class='line'>Thicker the drizzle grew, deeper the gloom;</p>
<p class='line'>Last, as it seem’d, a great mist-blotted light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>680</span></p>
<p class='line'>Flared on him, and he came upon the place.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then down the long street having slowly stolen,</p>
<p class='line'>His heart foreshadowing all calamity,</p>
<p class='line'>His eyes upon the stones, he reach’d the home</p>
<p class='line'>Where Annie lived and loved him, and his babes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>685</span></p>
<p class='line'>In those far-off seven happy years were born;</p>
<p class='line'>But finding neither light nor murmur there</p>
<p class='line'>(A bill of sale gleam’d thro’ the drizzle) crept</p>
<p class='line'>Still downward thinking ‘dead or dead to me!’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Down to the pool and narrow wharf he went,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>690</span></p>
<p class='line'>Seeking a tavern which of old he knew,</p>
<p class='line'>A front of timber-crost antiquity,</p>
<p class='line'>So propt, worm-eaten, ruinously old,</p>
<p class='line'>He thought it must have gone; but he was gone</p>
<p class='line'>Who kept it; and his widow, Miriam Lane,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>695</span></p>
<p class='line'>With daily-dwindling profits held the house;</p>
<p class='line'>A haunt of brawling seamen once, but now</p>
<p class='line'>Stiller, with yet a bed for wandering men.</p>
<p class='line'>There Enoch rested silent many days.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But Miriam Lane was good and garrulous,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>700</span></p>
<p class='line'>Nor let him be, but often breaking in,</p>
<p class='line'>Told him with other annals of the port,</p>
<p class='line'>Not knowing—Enoch was so brown, so bow’d</p>
<p class='line'>So broken—all the story of his house.</p>
<p class='line'>His baby’s death, her growing poverty,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>705</span></p>
<p class='line'>How Philip put her little ones to school,</p>
<p class='line'>And kept them in it, his long wooing her,</p>
<p class='line'>Her slow consent, and marriage, and the birth</p>
<p class='line'>Of Philip’s child: and o’er his countenance</p>
<p class='line'>No shadow past, nor motion: anyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>710</span></p>
<p class='line'>Regarding, well had deem’d he felt the tale</p>
<p class='line'>Less than the teller: only when she closed</p>
<p class='line'>‘Enoch, poor man, was cast away and lost’</p>
<p class='line'>He, shaking his gray head pathetically,</p>
<p class='line'>Repeated muttering ‘cast away and lost;’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>715</span></p>
<p class='line'>Again in deeper inward whispers ‘lost!’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But Enoch yearn’d to see her face again;</p>
<p class='line'>‘If I might look on her sweet face again</p>
<p class='line'>And know that she is happy.’ So the thought</p>
<p class='line'>Haunted and harass’d him, and drove him forth,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>720</span></p>
<p class='line'>At evening when the dull November day</p>
<p class='line'>Was growing duller twilight, to the hill.</p>
<p class='line'>There he sat down gazing on all below;</p>
<p class='line'>There did a thousand memories roll upon him,</p>
<p class='line'>Unspeakable for sadness. By and by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>725</span></p>
<p class='line'>The ruddy square of comfortable light,</p>
<p class='line'>Far-blazing from the rear of Philip’s house,</p>
<p class='line'>Allured him, as the beacon-blaze allures</p>
<p class='line'>The bird of passage, till he madly strikes</p>
<p class='line'>Against it, and beats out his weary life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>730</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For Philip’s dwelling fronted on the street,</p>
<p class='line'>The latest house to landward; but behind,</p>
<p class='line'>With one small gate that open’d on the waste,</p>
<p class='line'>Flourish’d a little garden square and wall’d:</p>
<p class='line'>And in it throve an ancient evergreen,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>735</span></p>
<p class='line'>A yewtree, and all around it ran a walk</p>
<p class='line'>Of shingle, and a walk divided it:</p>
<p class='line'>But Enoch shunn’d the middle walk and stole</p>
<p class='line'>Up by the wall, behind the yew; and thence</p>
<p class='line'>That which he better might have shunn’d, if griefs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>740</span></p>
<p class='line'>Like his have worse or better, Enoch saw.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For cups and silver on the burnish’d board</p>
<p class='line'>Sparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:</p>
<p class='line'>And on the right hand of the hearth he saw</p>
<p class='line'>Philip, the slighted suitor of old times,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>745</span></p>
<p class='line'>Stout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;</p>
<p class='line'>And o’er her second father stoopt a girl,</p>
<p class='line'>A later but a loftier Annie Lee,</p>
<p class='line'>Fair-hair’d and tall, and from her lifted hand</p>
<p class='line'>Dangled a length of ribbon and a ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>750</span></p>
<p class='line'>To tempt the babe, who rear’d his creasy arms,</p>
<p class='line'>Caught at and ever miss’d it, and they laugh’d:</p>
<p class='line'>And on the left hand of the hearth he saw</p>
<p class='line'>The mother glancing often toward her babe,</p>
<p class='line'>But turning now and then to speak with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>755</span></p>
<p class='line'>Her son, who stood beside her tall and strong,</p>
<p class='line'>And saying that which pleased him, for he smiled.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Now when the dead man come to life beheld</p>
<p class='line'>His wife his wife no more, and saw the babe</p>
<p class='line'>Hers, yet not his, upon the father’s knee,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>760</span></p>
<p class='line'>And all the warmth, the peace, the happiness,</p>
<p class='line'>And his own children tall and beautiful,</p>
<p class='line'>And him, that other, reigning in his place,</p>
<p class='line'>Lord of his rights and of his children’s love,—</p>
<p class='line'>Then he, tho’ Miriam Lane had told him all,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>765</span></p>
<p class='line'>Because things seen are mightier than things heard,</p>
<p class='line'>Stagger’d and shook, holding the branch, and fear’d</p>
<p class='line'>To send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,</p>
<p class='line'>Which in one moment, like the blast of doom,</p>
<p class='line'>Would shatter all the happiness of the hearth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>770</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He therefore turning softly like a thief,</p>
<p class='line'>Lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,</p>
<p class='line'>And feeling all along the garden-wall,</p>
<p class='line'>Lest he should swoon and tumble and be found,</p>
<p class='line'>Crept to the gate, and open’d it, and closed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>775</span></p>
<p class='line'>As lightly as a sick man’s chamber-door,</p>
<p class='line'>Behind him, and came out upon the waste.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And there he would have knelt, but that his knees</p>
<p class='line'>Were feeble, so that falling prone he dug</p>
<p class='line'>His fingers into the wet earth, and pray’d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>780</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;‘Too hard to bear! why did they take me thence?</p>
<p class='line'>O God Almighty, blessed Saviour, Thou</p>
<p class='line'>That did’st uphold me on my lonely isle,</p>
<p class='line'>Uphold me, Father, in my loneliness</p>
<p class='line'>A little longer! aid me, give me strength&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>785</span></p>
<p class='line'>Not to tell her, never to let her know.</p>
<p class='line'>Help me not to break in upon her peace.</p>
<p class='line'>My children too! must I not speak to these?</p>
<p class='line'>They know me not. I should betray myself.</p>
<p class='line'>Never: no father’s kiss for me—the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>790</span></p>
<p class='line'>So like her mother, and the boy, my son.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;There speech and thought and nature fail’d a little,</p>
<p class='line'>And he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced</p>
<p class='line'>Back toward his solitary home again,</p>
<p class='line'>All down the long and narrow street he went&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>795</span></p>
<p class='line'>Beating it in upon his weary brain,</p>
<p class='line'>As tho’ it were the burthen of a song,</p>
<p class='line'>‘Not to tell her, never to let her know.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He was not all unhappy. His resolve</p>
<p class='line'>Upbore him, and firm faith, and evermore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>800</span></p>
<p class='line'>Prayer from the living source within the will,</p>
<p class='line'>And beating up thro’ all the bitter world,</p>
<p class='line'>Like fountains of sweet water in the sea,</p>
<p class='line'>Kept him a living soul. ‘This miller’s wife’</p>
<p class='line'>He said to Miriam ‘that you told me of,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>805</span></p>
<p class='line'>Has she no fear that her first husband lives?’</p>
<p class='line'>‘Ay, ay, poor soul’ said Miriam, ‘fear enow!</p>
<p class='line'>If you could tell her you had seen him dead,</p>
<p class='line'>Why, that would be her comfort;’ and he thought</p>
<p class='line'>‘After the Lord has call’d me she shall know,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>810</span></p>
<p class='line'>I wait his time’ and Enoch set himself,</p>
<p class='line'>Scorning an alms, to work whereby to live.</p>
<p class='line'>Almost to all things could he turn his hand.</p>
<p class='line'>Cooper he was and carpenter, and wrought</p>
<p class='line'>To make the boatmen fishing-nets, or help’d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>815</span></p>
<p class='line'>At lading and unlading the tall barks,</p>
<p class='line'>That brought the stinted commerce of those days;</p>
<p class='line'>Thus earn’d a scanty living for himself:</p>
<p class='line'>Yet since he did but labour for himself,</p>
<p class='line'>Work without hope, there was not life in it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>820</span></p>
<p class='line'>Whereby the man could live; and as the year</p>
<p class='line'>Roll’d itself round again to meet the day</p>
<p class='line'>When Enoch had return’d, a languor came</p>
<p class='line'>Upon him, gentle sickness, gradually</p>
<p class='line'>Weakening the man, till he could do no more,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>825</span></p>
<p class='line'>But kept the house, his chair, and last his bed.</p>
<p class='line'>And Enoch bore his weakness cheerfully.</p>
<p class='line'>For sure no gladlier does the stranded wreck</p>
<p class='line'>See thro’ the gray skirts of a lifting squall</p>
<p class='line'>The boat that bears the hope of life approach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>830</span></p>
<p class='line'>To save the life despair’d of, than he saw</p>
<p class='line'>Death dawning on him, and the close of all.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For thro’ that dawning gleam’d a kindlier hope</p>
<p class='line'>On Enoch thinking ‘after I am gone,</p>
<p class='line'>Then may she learn I loved her to the last.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>835</span></p>
<p class='line'>He call’d aloud for Miriam Lane and said</p>
<p class='line'>‘Woman, I have a secret—only swear,</p>
<p class='line'>Before I tell you—swear upon the book</p>
<p class='line'>Not to reveal it, till you see me dead.’</p>
<p class='line'>‘Dead,’ clamour’d the good woman, ‘hear him talk!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>840</span></p>
<p class='line'>I warrant, man, that we shall bring you round.’</p>
<p class='line'>‘Swear’ added Enoch sternly ‘on the book.’</p>
<p class='line'>And on the book, half-frighted, Miriam swore.</p>
<p class='line'>Then Enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her,</p>
<p class='line'>‘Did you know Enoch Arden of this town?’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>845</span></p>
<p class='line'>‘Know him?’ she said ‘I knew him far away.</p>
<p class='line'>Ay, ay, I mind him coming down the street;</p>
<p class='line'>Held his head high, and cared for no man, he.’</p>
<p class='line'>Slowly and sadly Enoch answer’d her;</p>
<p class='line'>‘His head is low, and no man cares for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>850</span></p>
<p class='line'>I think I have not three days more to live;</p>
<p class='line'>I am the man.’ At which the woman gave</p>
<p class='line'>A half-incredulous, half-hysterical cry.</p>
<p class='line'>‘You Arden, you! nay,—sure he was a foot</p>
<p class='line'>Higher than you be.’ Enoch said again&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>855</span></p>
<p class='line'>‘My God has bow’d me down to what I am;</p>
<p class='line'>My grief and solitude have broken me;</p>
<p class='line'>Nevertheless, know you that I am he</p>
<p class='line'>Who married—but that name has twice been changed—</p>
<p class='line'>I married her who married Philip Ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>860</span></p>
<p class='line'>Sit, listen.’ Then he told her of his voyage,</p>
<p class='line'>His wreck, his lonely life, his coming back,</p>
<p class='line'>His gazing in on Annie, his resolve,</p>
<p class='line'>And how he kept it. As the woman heard,</p>
<p class='line'>Fast flow’d the current of her easy tears,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>865</span></p>
<p class='line'>While in her heart she yearn’d incessantly</p>
<p class='line'>To rush abroad all round the little haven,</p>
<p class='line'>Proclaiming Enoch Arden and his woes;</p>
<p class='line'>But awed and promise-bounden she forebore,</p>
<p class='line'>Saying only ‘See your bairns before you go!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>870</span></p>
<p class='line'>Eh, let me fetch ’em, Arden,’ and arose</p>
<p class='line'>Eager to bring them down, for Enoch hung</p>
<p class='line'>A moment on her words, but then replied:</p>
<p class='line'>‘Woman, disturb me not now at the last,</p>
<p class='line'>But let me hold my purpose till I die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>875</span></p>
<p class='line'>Sit down again; mark me and understand,</p>
<p class='line'>While I have power to speak. I charge you now,</p>
<p class='line'>When you shall see her, tell her that I died</p>
<p class='line'>Blessing her, praying for her, loving her;</p>
<p class='line'>Save for the bar between us, loving her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>880</span></p>
<p class='line'>As when she laid her head beside my own.</p>
<p class='line'>And tell my daughter Annie, whom I saw</p>
<p class='line'>So like her mother, that my latest breath</p>
<p class='line'>Was spent in blessing her and praying for her.</p>
<p class='line'>And tell my son that I died blessing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>885</span></p>
<p class='line'>And say to Philip that I blest him too;</p>
<p class='line'>He never meant us any thing but good.</p>
<p class='line'>But if my children care to see me dead,</p>
<p class='line'>Who hardly knew me living, let them come,</p>
<p class='line'>I am their father; but she must not come,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>890</span></p>
<p class='line'>For my dead face would vex her after-life.</p>
<p class='line'>And now there is but one of all my blood,</p>
<p class='line'>Who will embrace me in the world-to-be:</p>
<p class='line'>This hair is his: she cut it off and gave it,</p>
<p class='line'>And I have borne it with me all these years,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>895</span></p>
<p class='line'>And thought to bear it with me to my grave;</p>
<p class='line'>But now my mind is changed, for I shall see him,</p>
<p class='line'>My babe in bliss: wherefore when I am gone,</p>
<p class='line'>Take, give her this, for it may comfort her:</p>
<p class='line'>It will moreover be a token to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>900</span></p>
<p class='line'>That I am he.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He ceased; and Miriam Lane</p>
<p class='line'>Made such a voluble answer promising all,</p>
<p class='line'>That once again he roll’d his eyes upon her</p>
<p class='line'>Repeating all he wish’d, and once again&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>905</span></p>
<p class='line'>She promised.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then the third night after this,</p>
<p class='line'>While Enoch slumber’d motionless and pale,</p>
<p class='line'>And Miriam watch’d and dozed at intervals,</p>
<p class='line'>There came so loud a calling of the sea,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>910</span></p>
<p class='line'>That all the houses in the haven rang.</p>
<p class='line'>He woke, he rose, he spread his arms abroad</p>
<p class='line'>Crying with a loud voice ‘a sail! a sail!</p>
<p class='line'>I am saved’; and so fell back and spoke no more.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So past the strong heroic soul away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>915</span></p>
<p class='line'>And when they buried him the little port</p>
<p class='line'>Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>So all day long the noise of battle roll’d</p>
<p class='line'>Among the mountains by the winter sea;</p>
<p class='line'>Until King Arthur’s table, man by man,</p>
<p class='line'>Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord,</p>
<p class='line'>King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>5</span></p>
<p class='line'>The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,</p>
<p class='line'>Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,</p>
<p class='line'>And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,</p>
<p class='line'>A broken chancel with a broken cross,</p>
<p class='line'>That stood on a dark strait of barren land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>10</span></p>
<p class='line'>On one side lay the Ocean, and on one</p>
<p class='line'>Lay a great water, and the moon was full.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</p>
<p class='line'>‘The sequel of to-day unsolders all</p>
<p class='line'>The goodliest fellowship of famous knights&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>15</span></p>
<p class='line'>Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep</p>
<p class='line'>They sleep—the men I loved. I think that we</p>
<p class='line'>Shall never more, at any future time,</p>
<p class='line'>Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,</p>
<p class='line'>Walking about the gardens and the halls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>20</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of Camelot, as in the days that were.</p>
<p class='line'>I perish by this people which I made,—</p>
<p class='line'>Tho’ Merlin sware that I should come again</p>
<p class='line'>To rule once more—but let what will be, be,</p>
<p class='line'>I am so deeply smitten thro’ the helm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>25</span></p>
<p class='line'>That without help I cannot last till morn.</p>
<p class='line'>Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,</p>
<p class='line'>Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how</p>
<p class='line'>In those old days, one summer noon, an arm</p>
<p class='line'>Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>30</span></p>
<p class='line'>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</p>
<p class='line'>Holding the sword—and how I row’d across</p>
<p class='line'>And took it, and have worn it, like a king:</p>
<p class='line'>And, wheresoever I am sung or told</p>
<p class='line'>In aftertime, this also shall be known:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>35</span></p>
<p class='line'>But now delay not: take Excalibur,</p>
<p class='line'>And fling him far into the middle mere:</p>
<p class='line'>Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:</p>
<p class='line'>‘It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>40</span></p>
<p class='line'>Aidless, alone, and smitten thro’ the helm.</p>
<p class='line'>A little thing may harm a wounded man.</p>
<p class='line'>Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,</p>
<p class='line'>Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So saying, from the ruin’d shrine he stept&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>45</span></p>
<p class='line'>And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,</p>
<p class='line'>Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,</p>
<p class='line'>Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang</p>
<p class='line'>Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down</p>
<p class='line'>By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>50</span></p>
<p class='line'>Came on the shining levels of the lake.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,</p>
<p class='line'>And o’er him, drawing it, the winter moon,</p>
<p class='line'>Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth</p>
<p class='line'>And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>55</span></p>
<p class='line'>For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,</p>
<p class='line'>Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work</p>
<p class='line'>Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long</p>
<p class='line'>That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,</p>
<p class='line'>This way and that dividing the swift mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>60</span></p>
<p class='line'>In act to throw: but at the last it seem’d</p>
<p class='line'>Better to leave Excalibur conceal’d</p>
<p class='line'>There in the many-knotted waterflags,</p>
<p class='line'>That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.</p>
<p class='line'>So strode he back slow to the wounded King.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>65</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</p>
<p class='line'>‘Hast thou perform’d my mission which I gave?</p>
<p class='line'>What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</p>
<p class='line'>‘I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>70</span></p>
<p class='line'>And the wild water lapping on the crag.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:</p>
<p class='line'>‘Thou hast betray’d thy nature and thy name,</p>
<p class='line'>Not rendering true answer, as beseem’d</p>
<p class='line'>Thy fëalty, nor like a noble knight:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>75</span></p>
<p class='line'>For surer sign had follow’d, either hand,</p>
<p class='line'>Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.</p>
<p class='line'>This is a shameful thing for men to lie.</p>
<p class='line'>Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again</p>
<p class='line'>As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>80</span></p>
<p class='line'>I bad thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then went Sir Bedivere the second time</p>
<p class='line'>Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,</p>
<p class='line'>Counting the dewy pebbles, fix’d in thought;</p>
<p class='line'>But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>85</span></p>
<p class='line'>How curiously and strangely chased, he smote</p>
<p class='line'>His palms together, and he cried aloud,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;‘And if indeed I cast the brand away,</p>
<p class='line'>Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,</p>
<p class='line'>Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>90</span></p>
<p class='line'>Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.</p>
<p class='line'>What good should follow this, if this were done?</p>
<p class='line'>What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,</p>
<p class='line'>Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.</p>
<p class='line'>Were it well to obey then, if a king demand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>95</span></p>
<p class='line'>An act unprofitable, against himself?</p>
<p class='line'>The King is sick, and knows not what he does.</p>
<p class='line'>What record, or what relic of my lord</p>
<p class='line'>Should be to aftertime, but empty breath</p>
<p class='line'>And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>100</span></p>
<p class='line'>Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,</p>
<p class='line'>Some one might show it at a joust of arms,</p>
<p class='line'>Saying, “King Arthur’s sword, Excalibur,</p>
<p class='line'>Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake</p>
<p class='line'>Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>105</span></p>
<p class='line'>Upon the hidden bases of the hills.”</p>
<p class='line'>So might some old man speak in the aftertime</p>
<p class='line'>To all the people, winning reverence.</p>
<p class='line'>But now much honour and much fame were lost.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>110</span></p>
<p class='line'>And hid Excalibur the second time,</p>
<p class='line'>And so strode back slow to the wounded King.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:</p>
<p class='line'>‘What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>115</span></p>
<p class='line'>‘I heard the water lapping on the crag,</p>
<p class='line'>And the long ripple washing in the reeds.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:</p>
<p class='line'>‘Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,</p>
<p class='line'>Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>120</span></p>
<p class='line'>Authority forgets a dying king,</p>
<p class='line'>Laid widow’d of the power in his eye</p>
<p class='line'>That bow’d the will. I see thee what thou art,</p>
<p class='line'>For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,</p>
<p class='line'>In whom should meet the offices of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>125</span></p>
<p class='line'>Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;</p>
<p class='line'>Either from lust of gold, or like a girl</p>
<p class='line'>Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.</p>
<p class='line'>Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,</p>
<p class='line'>And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>130</span></p>
<p class='line'>But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,</p>
<p class='line'>I will arise and slay thee with my hands.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,</p>
<p class='line'>And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged</p>
<p class='line'>Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch’d the sword,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>135</span></p>
<p class='line'>And strongly wheel’d and threw it. The great brand</p>
<p class='line'>Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,</p>
<p class='line'>And flashing round and round, and whirl’d in an arch,</p>
<p class='line'>Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,</p>
<p class='line'>Seen where the moving isles of winter shock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>140</span></p>
<p class='line'>By night, with noises of the northern sea.</p>
<p class='line'>So flash’d and fell the brand Excalibur:</p>
<p class='line'>But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm</p>
<p class='line'>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</p>
<p class='line'>And caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>145</span></p>
<p class='line'>Three times, and drew him under in the mere.</p>
<p class='line'>And lightly went the other to the King.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:</p>
<p class='line'>‘Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.</p>
<p class='line'>Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>150</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</p>
<p class='line'>‘Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems</p>
<p class='line'>Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,</p>
<p class='line'>Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,</p>
<p class='line'>Not tho’ I live three lives of mortal men,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>155</span></p>
<p class='line'>So great a miracle as yonder hilt.</p>
<p class='line'>Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;</p>
<p class='line'>But when I look’d again, behold an arm,</p>
<p class='line'>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</p>
<p class='line'>That caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>160</span></p>
<p class='line'>Three times, and drew him under in the mere.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:</p>
<p class='line'>‘My end draws nigh; ’tis time that I were gone.</p>
<p class='line'>Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,</p>
<p class='line'>And bear me to the margin; yet I fear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>165</span></p>
<p class='line'>My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So saying, from the pavement he half rose,</p>
<p class='line'>Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,</p>
<p class='line'>And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes</p>
<p class='line'>As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>170</span></p>
<p class='line'>Remorsefully regarded thro’ his tears,</p>
<p class='line'>And would have spoken, but he found not words,</p>
<p class='line'>Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,</p>
<p class='line'>O’er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,</p>
<p class='line'>And rising bore him thro’ the place of tombs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>175</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But, as he walk’d, King Arthur panted hard,</p>
<p class='line'>Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed</p>
<p class='line'>When all the house is mute. So sigh’d the King,</p>
<p class='line'>Muttering and murmuring at his ear, ‘Quick, quick!</p>
<p class='line'>I fear it is too late, and I shall die.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>180</span></p>
<p class='line'>But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,</p>
<p class='line'>Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk’d,</p>
<p class='line'>Larger than human on the frozen hills.</p>
<p class='line'>He heard the deep behind him, and a cry</p>
<p class='line'>Before. His own thought drove him, like a goad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>185</span></p>
<p class='line'>Dry clash’d his harness in the icy caves</p>
<p class='line'>And barren chasms, and all to left and right</p>
<p class='line'>The bare black cliff clang’d round him, as he based</p>
<p class='line'>His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang</p>
<p class='line'>Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>190</span></p>
<p class='line'>And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,</p>
<p class='line'>And the long glories of the winter moon.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,</p>
<p class='line'>Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,</p>
<p class='line'>Beneath them; and descending they were ware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>195</span></p>
<p class='line'>That all the decks were dense with stately forms</p>
<p class='line'>Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these</p>
<p class='line'>Three Queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose</p>
<p class='line'>A cry that shiver’d to the tingling stars,</p>
<p class='line'>And, as it were one voice, an agony&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>200</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills</p>
<p class='line'>All night in a waste land, where no one comes,</p>
<p class='line'>Or hath come, since the making of the world.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then murmur’d Arthur, ‘Place me in the barge,’</p>
<p class='line'>And to the barge they came. There those three Queens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>205</span></p>
<p class='line'>Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.</p>
<p class='line'>But she, that rose the tallest of them all</p>
<p class='line'>And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,</p>
<p class='line'>And loosed the shatter’d casque, and chafed his hands,</p>
<p class='line'>And call’d him by his name, complaining loud,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>210</span></p>
<p class='line'>And dropping bitter tears against his brow</p>
<p class='line'>Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white</p>
<p class='line'>And colourless, and like the wither’d moon</p>
<p class='line'>Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;</p>
<p class='line'>And all his greaves and cuisses dash’d with drops&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>215</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls—</p>
<p class='line'>That made his forehead like a rising sun</p>
<p class='line'>High from the daïs-throne—were parch’d with dust,</p>
<p class='line'>Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,</p>
<p class='line'>Mix’d with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>220</span></p>
<p class='line'>So like a shatter’d column lay the King;</p>
<p class='line'>Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,</p>
<p class='line'>From spur to plume a star of tournament,</p>
<p class='line'>Shot thro’ the lists at Camelot, and charged</p>
<p class='line'>Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>225</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere,</p>
<p class='line'>‘Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?</p>
<p class='line'>Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?</p>
<p class='line'>For now I see the true old times are dead,</p>
<p class='line'>When every morning brought a noble chance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>230</span></p>
<p class='line'>And every chance brought out a noble knight.</p>
<p class='line'>Such times have been not since the light that led</p>
<p class='line'>The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.</p>
<p class='line'>But now the whole <span style='font-size:smaller'>ROUND TABLE</span> is dissolved</p>
<p class='line'>Which was an image of the mighty world;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>235</span></p>
<p class='line'>And I, the last, go forth companionless,</p>
<p class='line'>And the days darken round me, and the years,</p>
<p class='line'>Among new men, strange faces, other minds.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The old order changeth, yielding place to new,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>240</span></p>
<p class='line'>And God fulfils Himself in many ways,</p>
<p class='line'>Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.</p>
<p class='line'>Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?</p>
<p class='line'>I have lived my life, and that which I have done</p>
<p class='line'>May He within Himself make pure! but thou,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>245</span></p>
<p class='line'>If thou shouldst never see my face again,</p>
<p class='line'>Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer</p>
<p class='line'>Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice</p>
<p class='line'>Rise like a fountain for me night and day.</p>
<p class='line'>For what are men better than sheep or goats&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>250</span></p>
<p class='line'>That nourish a blind life within the brain,</p>
<p class='line'>If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer</p>
<p class='line'>Both for themselves and those who call them friend?</p>
<p class='line'>For so the whole round earth is every way</p>
<p class='line'>Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>255</span></p>
<p class='line'>But now farewell. I am going a long way</p>
<p class='line'>With these thou seëst—if indeed I go—</p>
<p class='line'>(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)</p>
<p class='line'>To the island-valley of Avilion;</p>
<p class='line'>Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>260</span></p>
<p class='line'>Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies</p>
<p class='line'>Deep-meadow’d, happy, fair with orchard-lawns</p>
<p class='line'>And bowery hollows crown’d with summer sea,</p>
<p class='line'>Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So said he, and the barge with oar and sail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>265</span></p>
<p class='line'>Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan</p>
<p class='line'>That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,</p>
<p class='line'>Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood</p>
<p class='line'>With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere</p>
<p class='line'>Revolving many memories, till the hull&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>270</span></p>
<p class='line'>Look’d one black dot against the verge of dawn,</p>
<p class='line'>And on the mere the wailing died away.</p>

<p class='line'>My hair is gray, but not with years,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Nor grew it white</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In a single night,</p>
<p class='line'>As men’s have grown from sudden fears;</p>
<p class='line'>My limbs are bow’d, though not with toil,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>5</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But rusted with a vile repose,</p>
<p class='line'>For they have been a dungeon’s spoil,</p>

<p class='line'>One in fire, and two in field,</p>
<p class='line'>Their belief with blood have seal’d;</p>
<p class='line'>Dying as their father died,</p>
<p class='line'>For the God their foes denied;</p>
<p class='line'>Three were in a dungeon cast,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>25</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of whom this wreck is left the last.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;II.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,</p>
<p class='line'>In Chillon’s dungeons deep and old,</p>
<p class='line'>There are seven columns, massy and gray,</p>
<p class='line'>Dim with a dull imprison’d ray,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>30</span></p>
<p class='line'>A sunbeam which hath lost its way,</p>
<p class='line'>And through the crevice and the cleft</p>
<p class='line'>Of the thick wall is fallen and left;</p>
<p class='line'>Creeping o’er the floor so damp,</p>
<p class='line'>Like a marsh’s meteor lamp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>35</span></p>
<p class='line'>And in each pillar there is a ring,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And in each ring there is a chain;</p>
<p class='line'>That iron is a cankering thing,</p>
<p class='line'>For in these limbs its teeth remain,</p>
<p class='line'>With marks that will not wear away,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>40</span></p>
<p class='line'>Till I have done with this new day,</p>
<p class='line'>Which now is painful to these eyes,</p>
<p class='line'>Which have not seen the sun so rise</p>
<p class='line'>For years—I cannot count them o’er,</p>
<p class='line'>I lost their long and heavy score&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>45</span></p>
<p class='line'>When my last brother droop’d and died</p>
<p class='line'>And I lay living by his side.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;III.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>They chain’d us each to a column stone</p>
<p class='line'>And we were three—yet, each alone;</p>
<p class='line'>We could not move a single pace,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>50</span></p>
<p class='line'>We could not see each other’s face,</p>
<p class='line'>But with that pale and livid light</p>
<p class='line'>That made us strangers in our sight;</p>
<p class='line'>And thus together—yet apart</p>
<p class='line'>Fetter’d in hand, but joined in heart;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>55</span></p>
<p class='line'>’Twas still some solace in the dearth</p>
<p class='line'>Of the pure elements of earth,</p>
<p class='line'>To hearken to each other’s speech,</p>
<p class='line'>And each turn comforter to each</p>
<p class='line'>With some new hope, or legend old,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>60</span></p>
<p class='line'>Or song heroically bold;</p>
<p class='line'>But even these at length grew cold.</p>
<p class='line'>Our voices took a dreary tone,</p>
<p class='line'>An echo of the dungeon-stone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A grating sound—not full and free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>65</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;As they of yore were wont to be;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It might be fancy—but to me</p>
<p class='line'>They never sounded like our own.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;IV.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>I was the eldest of the three,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And to uphold and cheer the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>70</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I ought to do—and did—my best,</p>
<p class='line'>And each did well in his degree.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The youngest, whom my father loved</p>
<p class='line'>Because our mother’s brow was given</p>
<p class='line'>To him—with eyes as blue as heaven—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>75</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For him my soul was sorely moved;</p>
<p class='line'>And truly might it be distrest</p>
<p class='line'>To see such bird in such a nest;</p>
<p class='line'>For he was beautiful as day—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;(When day was beautiful to me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>80</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;As to young eagles, being free)—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A polar day, which will not see</p>
<p class='line'>A sunset till its summer’s gone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Its sleepless summer of long light,</p>
<p class='line'>The snow-clad offspring of the sun;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>85</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And thus he was as pure and bright,</p>
<p class='line'>And in his natural spirit gay,</p>
<p class='line'>With tears for nought but others’ ills,</p>
<p class='line'>And then they flowed like mountain rills,</p>
<p class='line'>Unless he could assuage the woe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>90</span></p>
<p class='line'>Which he abhorr’d to view below.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;V.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The other was as pure of mind,</p>
<p class='line'>But form’d to combat with his kind;</p>
<p class='line'>Strong in his frame, and of a mood</p>
<p class='line'>Which ’gainst the world in war had stood,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>95</span></p>
<p class='line'>And perish’d in the foremost rank</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;With joy:—but not in chains to pine:</p>
<p class='line'>His spirit wither’d with their clank,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I saw it silently decline—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And so perchance in sooth did mine;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>100</span></p>
<p class='line'>But yet I forced it on to cheer</p>
<p class='line'>Those relics of a home so dear.</p>
<p class='line'>He was a hunter of the hills,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Had follow’d there the deer and wolf;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To him this dungeon was a gulf,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>105</span></p>
<p class='line'>And fetter’d feet the worst of ills.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;VI.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Lake Leman lies by Chillon’s walls:</p>
<p class='line'>A thousand feet in depth below</p>
<p class='line'>Its massy waters meet and flow;</p>
<p class='line'>Thus much the fathom-line was sent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>110</span></p>
<p class='line'>From Chillon’s snow-white battlement,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Which round about the wave inthrals:</p>
<p class='line'>A double dungeon wall and wave</p>
<p class='line'>Have made and like a living grave.</p>
<p class='line'>Below the surface of the lake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>115</span></p>
<p class='line'>The dark vault lies wherein we lay,</p>
<p class='line'>We heard it ripple night and day;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Sounding o’er our heads it knock’d;</p>
<p class='line'>And I have felt the winter’s spray</p>
<p class='line'>Wash through the bars when winds were high,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>120</span></p>
<p class='line'>And wanton in the happy sky;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And then the very rock hath rock’d.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And I have felt it shake, unshock’d,</p>
<p class='line'>Because I could have smiled to see</p>
<p class='line'>The death that would have set me free.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>125</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;VII.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>I said my nearer brother pined,</p>
<p class='line'>I said his mighty heart declined,</p>
<p class='line'>He loathed and put away his food:</p>
<p class='line'>It was not that ’twas coarse and rude,</p>
<p class='line'>For we were used to hunter’s fare,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>130</span></p>
<p class='line'>And for the like had little care:</p>
<p class='line'>The milk drawn from the mountain goat</p>
<p class='line'>Was changed for water from the moat,</p>
<p class='line'>Our bread was such as captives’ tears</p>
<p class='line'>Have moisten’d many a thousand years,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>135</span></p>
<p class='line'>Since man first pent his fellow-men</p>
<p class='line'>Like brutes within an iron den:</p>
<p class='line'>But what were these to us or him?</p>
<p class='line'>These wasted not his heart or limb;</p>
<p class='line'>My brother’s soul was of that mould&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>140</span></p>
<p class='line'>Which in a palace had grown cold,</p>
<p class='line'>Had his free breathing been denied</p>
<p class='line'>The range of the steep mountain’s side;</p>
<p class='line'>But why delay the truth?—he died.</p>
<p class='line'>I saw, and could not hold his head,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>145</span></p>
<p class='line'>Nor reach his dying hand—nor dead—</p>
<p class='line'>Though hard I strove, but strove in vain,</p>
<p class='line'>To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.</p>
<p class='line'>He died—and they unlock’d his chain,</p>
<p class='line'>And scoop’d for him a shallow grave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>150</span></p>
<p class='line'>Even from the cold earth of our cave.</p>
<p class='line'>I begg’d them, as a boon, to lay</p>
<p class='line'>His corse in dust whereon the day</p>
<p class='line'>Might shine—it was a foolish thought,</p>
<p class='line'>But then within my brain it wrought,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>155</span></p>
<p class='line'>That even in death his free-born breast</p>
<p class='line'>In such a dungeon could not rest.</p>
<p class='line'>I might have spared my idle prayer—</p>
<p class='line'>They coldly laugh’d—and laid him there:</p>
<p class='line'>The flat and turfless earth above&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>160</span></p>
<p class='line'>The being we so much did love;</p>
<p class='line'>His empty chain above it leant,</p>
<p class='line'>Such murder’s fitting monument!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;VIII.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But he, the favourite and the flower,</p>
<p class='line'>Most cherish’d since his natal hour,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>165</span></p>
<p class='line'>His mother’s image in fair face,</p>
<p class='line'>The infant love of all his race,</p>
<p class='line'>His martyr’d father’s dearest thought</p>
<p class='line'>My latest care, for whom I sought</p>
<p class='line'>To hoard my life, that his might be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>170</span></p>
<p class='line'>Less wretched now, and one day free;</p>
<p class='line'>He, too, who yet had held untired</p>
<p class='line'>A spirit natural or inspired—</p>
<p class='line'>He, too, was struck, and day by day</p>
<p class='line'>Was wither’d on the stalk away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>175</span></p>
<p class='line'>O God! it is a fearful thing</p>
<p class='line'>To see the human soul take wing</p>
<p class='line'>In any shape, in any mood:—</p>
<p class='line'>I’ve seen it rushing forth in blood,</p>
<p class='line'>I’ve seen it on the breaking ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>180</span></p>
<p class='line'>Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,</p>
<p class='line'>I’ve seen the sick and ghastly bed</p>
<p class='line'>Of Sin delirious with its dread:</p>
<p class='line'>But these were horrors—this was woe</p>
<p class='line'>Unmixed with such—but sure and slow;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>185</span></p>
<p class='line'>He faded, and so calm and meek,</p>
<p class='line'>So softly worn, so sweetly weak,</p>
<p class='line'>So tearless, yet so tender—kind,</p>
<p class='line'>And grieved for those he left behind;</p>
<p class='line'>With all the while a cheek whose bloom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>190</span></p>
<p class='line'>Was as a mockery of the tomb,</p>
<p class='line'>Whose tints as gently sunk away</p>
<p class='line'>As a departing rainbow’s ray—</p>
<p class='line'>An eye of most transparent light,</p>
<p class='line'>That almost made the dungeon bright,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>195</span></p>
<p class='line'>And not a word of murmur—not</p>
<p class='line'>A groan o’er his untimely lot—</p>
<p class='line'>A little talk of better days,</p>
<p class='line'>A little hope my own to raise,</p>
<p class='line'>For I was sunk in silence—lost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>200</span></p>
<p class='line'>In this last loss, of all the most;</p>
<p class='line'>And then the sighs he would suppress,</p>
<p class='line'>Of fainting nature’s feebleness,</p>
<p class='line'>More slowly drawn, grew less and less;</p>
<p class='line'>I listen’d, but I could not hear—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>205</span></p>
<p class='line'>I call’d, for I was wild with fear;</p>
<p class='line'>I knew ’twas hopeless, but my dread</p>
<p class='line'>Would not be thus admonished;</p>
<p class='line'>I call’d, and thought I heard a sound—</p>
<p class='line'>I burst my chain with one strong bound,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>210</span></p>
<p class='line'>And rush’d to him:—I found him not,</p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>I</span> only stirr’d in this black spot,</p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>I</span> only lived—<span class='it'>I</span> only drew</p>
<p class='line'>The accursed breath of dungeon-dew;</p>
<p class='line'>The last—the sole—the dearest link&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>215</span></p>
<p class='line'>Between me and the eternal brink,</p>
<p class='line'>Which bound me to my failing race,</p>
<p class='line'>Was broken in this fatal place.</p>
<p class='line'>One on the earth, and one beneath—</p>
<p class='line'>My brothers—both had ceased to breathe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>220</span></p>
<p class='line'>I took that hand which lay so still,</p>
<p class='line'>Alas! my own was full as chill;</p>
<p class='line'>I had not strength to stir, or strive,</p>
<p class='line'>But felt that I was still alive—</p>
<p class='line'>A frantic feeling, when we know&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>225</span></p>
<p class='line'>That what we love shall ne’er be so.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I know not why</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I could not die,</p>
<p class='line'>I had no earthly hope—but faith,</p>
<p class='line'>And that forbade a selfish death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>230</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;IX.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>What next befell me then and there</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I know not well—I never knew—</p>
<p class='line'>First came the loss of light, and air,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And then of darkness too:</p>
<p class='line'>I had no thought, no feeling—none—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>235</span></p>
<p class='line'>Among the stones I stood a stone,</p>
<p class='line'>And was, scarce conscious what I wist,</p>
<p class='line'>As shrubless crags within the mist;</p>
<p class='line'>For all was blank, and bleak, and gray,</p>
<p class='line'>It was not night—it was not day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>240</span></p>
<p class='line'>It was not even the dungeon-light,</p>
<p class='line'>So hateful to my heavy sight,</p>
<p class='line'>But vacancy absorbing space,</p>
<p class='line'>And fixedness—without a place;</p>
<p class='line'>There were no stars—no earth—no time—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>245</span></p>
<p class='line'>No check—no change—no good—no crime</p>
<p class='line'>But silence, and a stirless breath</p>
<p class='line'>Which neither was of life nor death;</p>
<p class='line'>A sea of stagnant idleness,</p>
<p class='line'>Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>250</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;X.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A light broke in upon my brain—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It was the carol of a bird;</p>
<p class='line'>It ceased, and then it came again,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The sweetest song ear ever heard,</p>
<p class='line'>And mine was thankful till my eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>255</span></p>
<p class='line'>Ran over with the glad surprise,</p>
<p class='line'>And they that moment could not see</p>
<p class='line'>I was the mate of misery;</p>
<p class='line'>But then by dull degrees came back</p>
<p class='line'>My senses to their wonted track,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>260</span></p>
<p class='line'>I saw the dungeon walls and floor</p>
<p class='line'>Close slowly round me as before,</p>
<p class='line'>I saw the glimmer of the sun</p>
<p class='line'>Creeping as it before had done,</p>
<p class='line'>But through the crevice where it came&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>265</span></p>
<p class='line'>That bird was perch’d, as fond and tame,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And tamer than upon the tree;</p>
<p class='line'>A lovely bird, with azure wings,</p>
<p class='line'>And song that said a thousand things,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And seem’d to say them all for me!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>270</span></p>
<p class='line'>I never saw its like before,</p>
<p class='line'>I ne’er shall see its likeness more:</p>
<p class='line'>It seem’d, like me, to want a mate,</p>
<p class='line'>But was not half so desolate,</p>
<p class='line'>And it was come to love me when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>275</span></p>
<p class='line'>None lived to love me so again,</p>
<p class='line'>And cheering from my dungeon’s brink,</p>
<p class='line'>Had brought me back to feel and think.</p>
<p class='line'>I know not if it late were free,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Or broke its cage to perch on mine,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>280</span></p>
<p class='line'>But knowing well captivity,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!</p>
<p class='line'>Or if it were, in winged guise,</p>
<p class='line'>A visitant from Paradise;</p>
<p class='line'>For—Heaven forgive that thought! the while&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>285</span></p>
<p class='line'>Which made me both to weep and smile—</p>
<p class='line'>I sometimes deem’d that it might be</p>
<p class='line'>My brother’s soul come down to me;</p>
<p class='line'>But then at last away it flew,</p>
<p class='line'>And then ’twas mortal—well I knew,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>290</span></p>
<p class='line'>For he would never thus have flown,</p>
<p class='line'>And left me twice so doubly lone—</p>
<p class='line'>Lone—as the corse within its shroud,</p>
<p class='line'>Lone—as a solitary cloud,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A single cloud on a sunny day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>295</span></p>
<p class='line'>While all the rest of heaven is clear,</p>
<p class='line'>A frown upon the atmosphere,</p>
<p class='line'>That hath no business to appear</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;When skies are blue, and earth is gay.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;XI.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A kind of change came in my fate,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>300</span></p>
<p class='line'>My keepers grew compassionate,</p>
<p class='line'>I know not what had made them so,</p>
<p class='line'>They were inured to sights of woe,</p>
<p class='line'>But so it was:—my broken chain</p>
<p class='line'>With links unfasten’d did remain,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>305</span></p>
<p class='line'>And it was liberty to stride</p>
<p class='line'>Along my cell from side to side,</p>
<p class='line'>And up and down, and then athwart,</p>
<p class='line'>And tread it over every part;</p>
<p class='line'>And round the pillars one by one,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>310</span></p>
<p class='line'>Returning where my walk begun,</p>
<p class='line'>Avoiding only, as I trod,</p>
<p class='line'>My brothers’ graves without a sod;</p>
<p class='line'>For if I thought with heedless tread</p>
<p class='line'>My step profaned their lowly bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>315</span></p>
<p class='line'>My breath came gaspingly and thick,</p>
<p class='line'>And my crush’d heart fell blind and sick.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;XII.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>I made a footing in the wall,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It was not therefrom to escape,</p>
<p class='line'>For I had buried one and all,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>320</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Who loved me in a human shape;</p>
<p class='line'>And the whole earth would henceforth be</p>
<p class='line'>A wider prison unto me:</p>
<p class='line'>No child—no sire—no kin had I,</p>
<p class='line'>No partner in my misery;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>325</span></p>
<p class='line'>I thought of this, and I was glad,</p>
<p class='line'>For thought of them had made me mad;</p>
<p class='line'>But I was curious to ascend</p>
<p class='line'>To my barr’d windows, and to bend</p>
<p class='line'>Once more, upon the mountains high,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>330</span></p>
<p class='line'>The quiet of a loving eye.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;XIII.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>I saw them—and they were the same,</p>
<p class='line'>They were not changed like me in frame;</p>
<p class='line'>I saw their thousand years of snow</p>
<p class='line'>On high—their wide long lake below,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>335</span></p>
<p class='line'>And the blue Rhone in fullest flow;</p>
<p class='line'>I heard the torrents leap and gush</p>
<p class='line'>O’er channell’d rock and broken bush;</p>
<p class='line'>I saw the white-wall’d distant town,</p>
<p class='line'>And whiter sails go skimming down;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>340</span></p>
<p class='line'>And then there was a little isle,</p>
<p class='line'>Which in my very face did smile,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The only one in view;</p>
<p class='line'>A small green isle, it seem’d no more,</p>
<p class='line'>Scarce broader than my dungeon floor;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>345</span></p>
<p class='line'>But in it there were three tall trees,</p>
<p class='line'>And o’er it blew the mountain breeze,</p>
<p class='line'>And by it there were waters flowing,</p>
<p class='line'>And on it there were young flowers growing,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of gentle breath and hue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>350</span></p>
<p class='line'>The fish swam by the castle wall,</p>
<p class='line'>And they seem’d joyous each and all;</p>
<p class='line'>The eagle rode the rising blast,</p>
<p class='line'>Methought he never flew so fast</p>
<p class='line'>As then to me he seem’d to fly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>355</span></p>
<p class='line'>And then new tears came in my eye,</p>
<p class='line'>And I felt troubled—and would fain</p>
<p class='line'>I had not left my recent chain;</p>
<p class='line'>And when I did descend again,</p>
<p class='line'>The darkness of my dim abode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>360</span></p>
<p class='line'>Fell on me as a heavy load;</p>
<p class='line'>It was as is a new-dug grave,</p>
<p class='line'>Closing o’er one we sought to save,</p>
<p class='line'>And yet my glance, too much opprest,</p>
<p class='line'>Had almost need of such a rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>365</span></p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;XIV.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>It might be months, or years, or days,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I kept no count—I took no note,</p>
<p class='line'>I had no hope my eyes to raise,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And clear them of their dreary mote;</p>
<p class='line'>At last men came to set me free,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>370</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I ask’d not why, and reck’d not where.</p>
<p class='line'>It was at length the same to me,</p>
<p class='line'>Fetter’d or fetterless to be,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I learn’d to love despair.</p>
<p class='line'>And thus when they appear’d at last,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>375</span></p>
<p class='line'>And all my bonds aside were cast,</p>
<p class='line'>These heavy walls to me had grown</p>
<p class='line'>A hermitage—and all my own!</p>
<p class='line'>And half I felt as they were come</p>
<p class='line'>To tear me from a second home:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>380</span></p>
<p class='line'>With spiders I had friendship made,</p>
<p class='line'>And watch’d them in their sullen trade,</p>
<p class='line'>Had seen the mice by moonlight play,</p>
<p class='line'>And why should I feel less than they?</p>
<p class='line'>We were all inmates of one place,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>385</span></p>
<p class='line'>And I, the monarch of each race,</p>
<p class='line'>Had power to kill—yet, strange to tell!</p>
<p class='line'>In quiet we had learn’d to dwell—</p>
<p class='line'>My very chains and I grew friends,</p>
<p class='line'>So much a long communion tends&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>390</span></p>
<p class='line'>To make us what we are:—Even I</p>
<p class='line'>Regain’d my freedom with a sigh.</p>

<p class='line'>Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To meet the sun upon the upland lawn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>100</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“There at the foot of yonder nodding beech,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,</p>
<p class='line'>His listless length at noontide would he stretch,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And pore upon the brook that babbles by.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>105</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Mutt’ring his wayward fancies he would rove;</p>
<p class='line'>Now drooping woeful-wan, like one forlorn,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Or craz’d with care, or cross’d in hopeless love.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“One morn I miss’d him on the custom’d hill,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Along the heath, and near his fav’rite tree;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>110</span></p>
<p class='line'>Another came; nor yet beside the rill,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“The next, with dirges due in sad array,</p>

<p class='line'>Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>115</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown:</p>
<p class='line'>Fair Science frown’d not on his humble birth,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Melancholy mark’d him for her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>120</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Heav’n did a recompense as largely send;</p>
<p class='line'>He gave to Mis’ry all he had, a tear,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He gain’d from Heav’n (’twas all he wish’d) a friend.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>No farther seek his merits to disclose,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>125</span></p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,</p>
<p class='line'>(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The bosom of his Father and his God.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,</p>
<p class='line'>Through all the wild border his steed was the best;</p>
<p class='line'>And, save his good broadsword, he weapons had none,</p>
<p class='line'>He rode all unarm’d, and he rode all alone.</p>
<p class='line'>So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>5</span></p>
<p class='line'>There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He staid not for brake, and he stopp’d not for stone,</p>
<p class='line'>He swam the Esk river where ford there was none;</p>
<p class='line'>But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,</p>
<p class='line'>The bride had consented, the gallant came late;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>10</span></p>
<p class='line'>For a laggard in love and a dastard in war,</p>
<p class='line'>Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>So boldly he enter’d the Netherby Hall,</p>
<p class='line'>Among bride’s-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:</p>
<p class='line'>Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>15</span></p>
<p class='line'>(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)</p>
<p class='line'>“O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,</p>
<p class='line'>Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?”—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied;—</p>
<p class='line'>Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>20</span></p>
<p class='line'>And now am I come, with this lost love of mine</p>
<p class='line'>To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.</p>
<p class='line'>There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far</p>
<p class='line'>That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The bride kiss’d the goblet: the knight took it up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>25</span></p>
<p class='line'>He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.</p>
<p class='line'>She look’d down to blush, and she look’d up to sigh,</p>
<p class='line'>With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye,</p>
<p class='line'>He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,—</p>
<p class='line'>“Now tread we a measure!” said young Lochinvar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>30</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>So stately his form, and so lovely her face,</p>
<p class='line'>There never a hall such a galliard did grace;</p>
<p class='line'>While her mother did fret and her father did fume,</p>
<p class='line'>And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;</p>
<p class='line'>And the bride-maidens whispered, “’Twere better by far&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>35</span></p>
<p class='line'>To have match’d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,</p>
<p class='line'>When they reach’d the hall-door, and the charger stood near;</p>
<p class='line'>So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,</p>
<p class='line'>So light to the saddle before her he sprung!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>40</span></p>
<p class='line'>“She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;</p>
<p class='line'>They’ll have fleet steeds that follow,” quoth young Lochinvar.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>There was mounting ’mong Græmes of the Netherby clan;</p>
<p class='line'>Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran;</p>
<p class='line'>There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>45</span></p>
<p class='line'>But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see.</p>
<p class='line'>So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,</p>
<p class='line'>Have ye e’er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur’s court,</p>
<p class='line'>A tributary prince of Devon, one</p>
<p class='line'>Of that great Order of the Table Round,</p>
<p class='line'>Had wedded Enid, Yniol’s only child,</p>
<p class='line'>And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>5</span></p>
<p class='line'>And as the light of Heaven varies, now</p>
<p class='line'>At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night</p>
<p class='line'>With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint</p>
<p class='line'>To make her beauty vary day by day,</p>
<p class='line'>In crimsons and in purples and in gems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>10</span></p>
<p class='line'>And Enid, but to please her husband’s eye,</p>
<p class='line'>Who first had found and loved her in a state</p>
<p class='line'>Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him</p>
<p class='line'>In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,</p>
<p class='line'>Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>15</span></p>
<p class='line'>Lov’d her, and often with her own white hands</p>
<p class='line'>Array’d and deck’d her, as the loveliest,</p>
<p class='line'>Next after her own self, in all the court.</p>
<p class='line'>And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart</p>
<p class='line'>Adored her, as the stateliest and the best&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>20</span></p>
<p class='line'>And loveliest of all women upon earth.</p>
<p class='line'>And seeing them so tender and so close</p>
<p class='line'>Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.</p>
<p class='line'>But when a rumour rose about the Queen,</p>
<p class='line'>Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>25</span></p>
<p class='line'>Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard</p>
<p class='line'>The world’s loud whisper breaking into storm,</p>
<p class='line'>Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell</p>
<p class='line'>A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,</p>
<p class='line'>Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>30</span></p>
<p class='line'>Had suffer’d, or should suffer any taint</p>
<p class='line'>In nature: wherefore going to the King,</p>
<p class='line'>He made this pretext, that his princedom lay</p>
<p class='line'>Close on the borders of a territory,</p>
<p class='line'>Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>35</span></p>
<p class='line'>Assassins, and all fliers from the hand</p>
<p class='line'>Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:</p>
<p class='line'>And therefore, till the King himself should please</p>
<p class='line'>To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,</p>
<p class='line'>He craved a fair permission to depart,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>40</span></p>
<p class='line'>And there defend his marches; and the King</p>
<p class='line'>Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,</p>
<p class='line'>Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,</p>
<p class='line'>And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores</p>
<p class='line'>Of Severn, and they pass’d to their own land;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>45</span></p>
<p class='line'>Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife</p>
<p class='line'>True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,</p>
<p class='line'>He compass’d her with sweet observances</p>
<p class='line'>And worship, never leaving her, and grew</p>
<p class='line'>Forgetful of his promise to the King,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>50</span></p>
<p class='line'>Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,</p>
<p class='line'>Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,</p>
<p class='line'>Forgetful of his glory and his name,</p>
<p class='line'>Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.</p>
<p class='line'>And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>55</span></p>
<p class='line'>And by and by the people, when they met</p>
<p class='line'>In twos and threes, or fuller companies,</p>
<p class='line'>Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him</p>
<p class='line'>As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,</p>
<p class='line'>And molten down in mere uxoriousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>60</span></p>
<p class='line'>And this she gather’d from the people’s eyes;</p>
<p class='line'>This too the women who attired her head,</p>
<p class='line'>To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,</p>
<p class='line'>Told Enid, and they sadden’d her the more:</p>
<p class='line'>And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>65</span></p>
<p class='line'>But could not out of bashful delicacy;</p>
<p class='line'>While he that watch’d her sadden, was the more</p>
<p class='line'>Suspicious that her nature had a taint.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;At last it chanced that on a summer morn</p>
<p class='line'>(They sleeping each by other) the new sun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>70</span></p>
<p class='line'>Beat through the blindless casement of the room,</p>
<p class='line'>And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;</p>
<p class='line'>Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,</p>
<p class='line'>And bared the knotted column of his throat,</p>
<p class='line'>The massive square of his heroic breast,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>75</span></p>
<p class='line'>And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,</p>
<p class='line'>As slopes a wild brook o’er a little stone,</p>
<p class='line'>Running too vehemently to break upon it.</p>
<p class='line'>And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,</p>
<p class='line'>Admiring him, and thought within herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>80</span></p>
<p class='line'>Was ever man so grandly made as he?</p>
<p class='line'>Then, like a shadow, pass’d the people’s talk</p>
<p class='line'>And accusation of uxoriousness</p>
<p class='line'>Across her mind, and bowing over him,</p>
<p class='line'>Low to her own heart piteously she said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>85</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“O noble breast and all-puissant arms,</p>
<p class='line'>Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men</p>
<p class='line'>Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?</p>
<p class='line'>I <span class='it'>am</span> the cause, because I dare not speak</p>
<p class='line'>And tell him what I think and what they say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>90</span></p>
<p class='line'>And yet I hate that he should linger here;</p>
<p class='line'>I cannot love my lord and not his name.</p>
<p class='line'>Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,</p>
<p class='line'>And ride with him to battle and stand by,</p>
<p class='line'>And watch his mightful hand striking great blows&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>95</span></p>
<p class='line'>At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.</p>
<p class='line'>Far better were I laid in the dark earth,</p>
<p class='line'>Not hearing any more his noble voice,</p>
<p class='line'>Not to be folded more in these dear arms,</p>
<p class='line'>And darken’d from the high light in his eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>100</span></p>
<p class='line'>Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.</p>
<p class='line'>Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,</p>
<p class='line'>And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,</p>
<p class='line'>Or maybe pierc’d to death before mine eyes,</p>
<p class='line'>And yet not dare to tell him what I think,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>105</span></p>
<p class='line'>And how men slur him, saying all his force</p>
<p class='line'>Is melted into mere effeminacy?</p>
<p class='line'>O me, I feel that I am no true wife.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,</p>
<p class='line'>And the strong passion in her made her weep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>110</span></p>
<p class='line'>True tears upon his broad and naked breast,</p>
<p class='line'>And these awoke him, and by great mischance</p>
<p class='line'>He heard but fragments of her later words,</p>
<p class='line'>And that she fear’d she was not a true wife.</p>
<p class='line'>And then he thought, “In spite of all my care,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>115</span></p>
<p class='line'>For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,</p>
<p class='line'>She is not faithful to me, and I see her</p>
<p class='line'>Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur’s hall.”</p>
<p class='line'>Then, though he lov’d and reverenc’d her too much</p>
<p class='line'>To dream she could be guilty of foul act,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>120</span></p>
<p class='line'>Right through his manful breast darted the pang</p>
<p class='line'>That makes a man, in the sweet face of her</p>
<p class='line'>Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.</p>
<p class='line'>At this he hurl’d his huge limbs out of bed,</p>
<p class='line'>And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>125</span></p>
<p class='line'>“My charger and her palfrey;” then to her,</p>
<p class='line'>“I will ride forth into the wilderness;</p>
<p class='line'>For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,</p>
<p class='line'>I have not fall’n so low as some would wish.</p>
<p class='line'>And you put on your worst and meanest dress&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>130</span></p>
<p class='line'>And ride with me.” And Enid ask’d, amaz’d,</p>
<p class='line'>“If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.”</p>
<p class='line'>But he, “I charge you, ask not, but obey.”</p>
<p class='line'>Then she bethought her of a faded silk,</p>
<p class='line'>A faded mantle and a faded veil,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>135</span></p>
<p class='line'>And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,</p>
<p class='line'>Wherein she kept them folded reverently</p>
<p class='line'>With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,</p>
<p class='line'>She took them, and array’d herself therein,</p>
<p class='line'>Remembering when first he came on her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>140</span></p>
<p class='line'>Drest in that dress, and how he lov’d her in it,</p>
<p class='line'>And all her foolish fears about the dress,</p>
<p class='line'>And all his journey to her, as himself</p>
<p class='line'>Had told her, and their coming to the court.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>145</span></p>
<p class='line'>Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.</p>
<p class='line'>There on a day, he sitting high in hall,</p>
<p class='line'>Before him came a forester of Dean,</p>
<p class='line'>Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart</p>
<p class='line'>Taller than all his fellows, milky white,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>150</span></p>
<p class='line'>First seen that day: these things he told the King.</p>
<p class='line'>Then the good King gave order to let blow</p>
<p class='line'>His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.</p>
<p class='line'>And when the Queen petition’d for his leave</p>
<p class='line'>To see the hunt, allow’d it easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>155</span></p>
<p class='line'>So with the morning all the court were gone.</p>
<p class='line'>But Guinevere lay late into the morn,</p>
<p class='line'>Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love</p>
<p class='line'>For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;</p>
<p class='line'>But rose at last, a single maiden with her,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>160</span></p>
<p class='line'>Took horse, and forded Usk, and gain’d the wood;</p>
<p class='line'>There, on a little knoll beside it, stay’d</p>
<p class='line'>Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead</p>
<p class='line'>A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,</p>
<p class='line'>Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>165</span></p>
<p class='line'>Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,</p>
<p class='line'>Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford</p>
<p class='line'>Behind them, and so gallop’d up the knoll.</p>
<p class='line'>A purple scarf, at either end whereof</p>
<p class='line'>There swung an apple of the purest gold,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>170</span></p>
<p class='line'>Sway’d round about him, as he gallop’d up</p>
<p class='line'>To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly</p>
<p class='line'>In summer suit and silks of holiday.</p>
<p class='line'>Low bow’d the tributary Prince, and she,</p>
<p class='line'>Sweetly and statelily, and with all grace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>175</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of womanhood and queenhood, answer’d him:</p>
<p class='line'>“Late, late, Sir Prince,” she said, “later than we!”</p>
<p class='line'>“Yea, noble Queen,” he answer’d, “and so late</p>
<p class='line'>That I but come like you to see the hunt,</p>
<p class='line'>Not join it.” “Therefore wait with me,” she said;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>180</span></p>
<p class='line'>“For on this little knoll, if anywhere,</p>
<p class='line'>There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:</p>
<p class='line'>Here often they break covert at our feet.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And while they listen’d for the distant hunt,</p>
<p class='line'>And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>185</span></p>
<p class='line'>King Arthur’s hound of deepest mouth, there rode</p>
<p class='line'>Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;</p>
<p class='line'>Whereof the dwarf lagg’d latest, and the knight</p>
<p class='line'>Had vizor up, and show’d a youthful face,</p>
<p class='line'>Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>190</span></p>
<p class='line'>And Guinevere, not mindful of his face</p>
<p class='line'>In the King’s hall, desired his name, and sent</p>
<p class='line'>Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;</p>
<p class='line'>Who being vicious, old and irritable,</p>
<p class='line'>And doubling all his master’s vice of pride,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>195</span></p>
<p class='line'>Made answer sharply that she should not know.</p>
<p class='line'>“Then will I ask it of himself,” she said.</p>
<p class='line'>“Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,” cried the dwarf;</p>
<p class='line'>“Thou art not worthy ev’n to speak of him;”</p>
<p class='line'>And when she put her horse toward the knight,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>200</span></p>
<p class='line'>Struck at her with his whip, and she return’d</p>
<p class='line'>Indignant to the Queen; at which Geraint</p>
<p class='line'>Exclaiming, “Surely I will learn the name,”</p>
<p class='line'>Made sharply to the dwarf, and ask’d it of him,</p>
<p class='line'>Who answer’d as before; and when the Prince&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>205</span></p>
<p class='line'>Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,</p>
<p class='line'>Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.</p>
<p class='line'>The Prince’s blood spirted upon the scarf,</p>
<p class='line'>Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand</p>
<p class='line'>Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>210</span></p>
<p class='line'>But he from his exceeding manfulness</p>
<p class='line'>And pure nobility of temperament,</p>
<p class='line'>Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrain’d</p>
<p class='line'>From ev’n a word, and so returning said:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>215</span></p>
<p class='line'>Done in your maiden’s person to yourself:</p>
<p class='line'>And I will track this vermin to their earths;</p>
<p class='line'>For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt</p>
<p class='line'>To find, at some place I shall come at, arms</p>
<p class='line'>On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>220</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,</p>
<p class='line'>And on the third day will again be here,</p>
<p class='line'>So that I be not fall’n in fight. Farewell.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Farewell, fair Prince,” answered the stately Queen,</p>
<p class='line'>“Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>225</span></p>
<p class='line'>And may you light on all things that you love,</p>
<p class='line'>And live to wed with her whom first you love.</p>
<p class='line'>But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,</p>
<p class='line'>And I, were she the daughter of a king,</p>
<p class='line'>Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>230</span></p>
<p class='line'>Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard</p>
<p class='line'>The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,</p>
<p class='line'>A little vex’d at losing of the hunt,</p>
<p class='line'>A little at the vile occasion, rode,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>235</span></p>
<p class='line'>By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade</p>
<p class='line'>And valley, with fix’d eye following the three.</p>
<p class='line'>At last they issued from the world of wood,</p>
<p class='line'>And climb’d upon a fair and even ridge,</p>
<p class='line'>And show’d themselves against the sky, and sank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>240</span></p>
<p class='line'>And thither came Geraint, and underneath</p>
<p class='line'>Beheld the long street of a little town</p>
<p class='line'>In a long valley, on one side of which,</p>
<p class='line'>White from the mason’s hand, a fortress rose;</p>
<p class='line'>And on one side a castle in decay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>245</span></p>
<p class='line'>Beyond a bridge that spann’d a dry ravine:</p>
<p class='line'>And out of town and valley came a noise</p>
<p class='line'>As of a broad brook o’er a shingly bed</p>
<p class='line'>Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks</p>
<p class='line'>At distance, ere they settle for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>250</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And onward to the fortress rode the three</p>
<p class='line'>And enter’d, and were lost behind the walls.</p>
<p class='line'>“So,” thought Geraint, “I have track’d him to his earth.”</p>
<p class='line'>And down the long street riding wearily,</p>
<p class='line'>Found every hostel full, and everywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>255</span></p>
<p class='line'>Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss</p>
<p class='line'>And bustling whistle of the youth who scour’d</p>
<p class='line'>His master’s armour; and of such a one</p>
<p class='line'>He ask’d, “What means the tumult in the town?”</p>
<p class='line'>Who told him, scouring still, “The sparrow-hawk!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>260</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then riding close behind an ancient churl,</p>
<p class='line'>Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,</p>
<p class='line'>Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,</p>
<p class='line'>Ask’d yet once more what meant the hubbub here?</p>
<p class='line'>Who answer’d gruffly, “Ugh! the sparrow-hawk,”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>265</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then riding farther past an armourer’s,</p>
<p class='line'>Who, with back turn’d, and bow’d above his work,</p>
<p class='line'>Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,</p>
<p class='line'>He put the self-same query; but the man</p>
<p class='line'>Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>270</span></p>
<p class='line'>“Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk</p>
<p class='line'>Has little time for idle questioners.”</p>
<p class='line'>Whereat Geraint flash’d into sudden spleen:</p>
<p class='line'>“A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!</p>
<p class='line'>Tits, wrens, and all wing’d nothings peck him dead!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>275</span></p>
<p class='line'>Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg</p>
<p class='line'>The murmur of the world! What is it to me?</p>
<p class='line'>O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,</p>
<p class='line'>Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!</p>
<p class='line'>Speak, if you be not like the rest, hawk-mad,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>280</span></p>
<p class='line'>Where can I get me harbourage for the night?</p>
<p class='line'>And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy? Speak!”</p>
<p class='line'>At this the armourer, turning all amazed</p>
<p class='line'>And seeing one so gay in purple silks,</p>
<p class='line'>Came forward with the helmet yet in hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>285</span></p>
<p class='line'>And answer’d, “Pardon me, O stranger knight;</p>
<p class='line'>We hold a tourney here to-morrow morn,</p>
<p class='line'>And there is scantly time for half the work.</p>
<p class='line'>Arms? truth! I know not: all are wanted here.</p>
<p class='line'>Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>290</span></p>
<p class='line'>It may be, at Earl Yniol’s, o’er the bridge</p>
<p class='line'>Yonder.” He spoke and fell to work again.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,</p>
<p class='line'>Across the bridge that spann’d the dry ravine.</p>
<p class='line'>There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>295</span></p>
<p class='line'>(His dress a suit of fray’d magnificence,</p>
<p class='line'>Once fit for feasts of ceremony), and said:</p>
<p class='line'>“Whither, fair son?” to whom Geraint replied,</p>
<p class='line'>“O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.”</p>
<p class='line'>Then Yniol, “Enter, therefore, and partake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>300</span></p>
<p class='line'>The slender entertainment of a house</p>
<p class='line'>Once rich, now poor, but ever open-door’d.”</p>
<p class='line'>“Thanks, venerable friend,” replied Geraint;</p>
<p class='line'>“So that you do not serve me sparrow-hawks</p>
<p class='line'>For supper, I will enter, I will eat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>305</span></p>
<p class='line'>With all the passion of a twelve hours’ fast.”</p>
<p class='line'>Then sigh’d and smil’d the hoary-headed Earl,</p>
<p class='line'>And answer’d, “Graver cause than yours is mine</p>
<p class='line'>To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk.</p>
<p class='line'>But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>310</span></p>
<p class='line'>We will not touch upon him ev’n in jest.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then rode Geraint into the castle court,</p>
<p class='line'>His charger trampling many a prickly star</p>
<p class='line'>Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.</p>
<p class='line'>He look’d, and saw that all was ruinous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>315</span></p>
<p class='line'>Here stood a shatter’d archway plumed with fern;</p>
<p class='line'>And here had fall’n a great part of a tower,</p>
<p class='line'>Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,</p>
<p class='line'>And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:</p>
<p class='line'>And high above a piece of turret stair,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>320</span></p>
<p class='line'>Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound</p>
<p class='line'>Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems</p>
<p class='line'>Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,</p>
<p class='line'>And suck’d the joining of the stones, and look’d</p>
<p class='line'>A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>325</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And while he waited in the castle court,</p>
<p class='line'>The voice of Enid, Yniol’s daughter, rang</p>
<p class='line'>Clear through the open casement of the hall,</p>
<p class='line'>Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,</p>
<p class='line'>Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>330</span></p>
<p class='line'>Moves him to think what kind of bird it is</p>
<p class='line'>That sings so delicately clear, and make</p>
<p class='line'>Conjecture of the plumage and the form,—</p>
<p class='line'>So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;</p>
<p class='line'>And made him like a man abroad at morn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>335</span></p>
<p class='line'>When first the liquid note beloved of men</p>
<p class='line'>Comes flying over many a windy wave</p>
<p class='line'>To Britain, and in April suddenly</p>
<p class='line'>Breaks from a coppice gemm’d with green and red,</p>
<p class='line'>And he suspends his converse with a friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>340</span></p>
<p class='line'>Or it may be the labour of his hands,</p>
<p class='line'>To think or say, “There is the nightingale,”—</p>
<p class='line'>So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,</p>
<p class='line'>“Here, by God’s grace, is the one voice for me.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It chanced the song that Enid sang was one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>345</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;</p>
<p class='line'>Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;</p>
<p class='line'>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>350</span></p>
<p class='line'>With that wild wheel we go not up or down;</p>
<p class='line'>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;</p>
<p class='line'>Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;</p>
<p class='line'>For man is man and master of his fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>355</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;</p>
<p class='line'>Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;</p>
<p class='line'>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Hark, by the bird’s song you may learn the nest,”</p>
<p class='line'>Said Yniol; “enter quickly.” Entering then,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>360</span></p>
<p class='line'>Right o’er a mount of newly-fallen stones,</p>
<p class='line'>The dusky-rafter’d many-cobwebb’d hall,</p>
<p class='line'>He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;</p>
<p class='line'>And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,</p>
<p class='line'>That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>365</span></p>
<p class='line'>Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,</p>
<p class='line'>Her daughter. In a moment thought Geraint,</p>
<p class='line'>“Here by God’s rood is the one maid for me.”</p>
<p class='line'>But none spake word except the hoary Earl:</p>
<p class='line'>“Enid, the good knight’s horse stands in the court;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>370</span></p>
<p class='line'>Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then</p>
<p class='line'>Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;</p>
<p class='line'>And we will make us merry as we may.</p>
<p class='line'>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He spake: the Prince, as Enid pass’d him, fain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>375</span></p>
<p class='line'>To follow, strode a stride; but Yniol caught</p>
<p class='line'>His purple scarf, and held, and said, “Forbear!</p>
<p class='line'>Rest! the good house, though ruin’d, O my son,</p>
<p class='line'>Endures not that her guest should serve himself.”</p>
<p class='line'>And reverencing the custom of the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>380</span></p>
<p class='line'>Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So Enid took his charger to the stall;</p>
<p class='line'>And after went her way across the bridge,</p>
<p class='line'>And reach’d the town, and while the Prince and Earl</p>
<p class='line'>Yet spoke together, came again with one,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>385</span></p>
<p class='line'>A youth, that following with a costrel bore</p>
<p class='line'>The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.</p>
<p class='line'>And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,</p>
<p class='line'>And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.</p>
<p class='line'>And then, because their hall must also serve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>390</span></p>
<p class='line'>For kitchen, boil’d the flesh and spread the board,</p>
<p class='line'>And stood behind, and waited on the three.</p>
<p class='line'>And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,</p>
<p class='line'>Geraint had a longing in him evermore</p>
<p class='line'>To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>395</span></p>
<p class='line'>That crost the trencher as she laid it down:</p>
<p class='line'>But after all had eaten, then Geraint,</p>
<p class='line'>For now the wine made summer in his veins,</p>
<p class='line'>Let his eye rove in following, or rest</p>
<p class='line'>On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>400</span></p>
<p class='line'>Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;</p>
<p class='line'>Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;</p>
<p class='line'>This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.</p>
<p class='line'>His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>405</span></p>
<p class='line'>For if he be the knight whom late I saw</p>
<p class='line'>Ride into that new fortress by your town,</p>
<p class='line'>White from the mason’s hand, then have I sworn</p>
<p class='line'>From his own lips to have it—I am Geraint</p>
<p class='line'>Of Devon—for this morning when the Queen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>410</span></p>
<p class='line'>Sent her own maiden to demand the name,</p>
<p class='line'>His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,</p>
<p class='line'>Struck at her with his whip, and she return’d</p>
<p class='line'>Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore</p>
<p class='line'>That I would track this caitiff to his hold,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>415</span></p>
<p class='line'>And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.</p>
<p class='line'>And all unarm’d I rode, and thought to find</p>
<p class='line'>Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;</p>
<p class='line'>They take the rustic murmur of their bourg</p>
<p class='line'>For the great wave that echoes round the world;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>420</span></p>
<p class='line'>They would not hear me speak; but if you know</p>
<p class='line'>Where I can light on arms, or if yourself</p>
<p class='line'>Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn</p>
<p class='line'>That I will break his pride and learn his name,</p>
<p class='line'>Avenging this great insult done the Queen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>425</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then cried Earl Yniol, “Art thou he indeed,</p>
<p class='line'>Geraint, a name far sounded among men</p>
<p class='line'>For noble deeds? and truly I, when first</p>
<p class='line'>I saw you moving by me on the bridge,</p>
<p class='line'>Felt you were somewhat, yea, and by your state&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>430</span></p>
<p class='line'>And presence might have guess’d you one of those</p>
<p class='line'>That eat in Arthur’s hall at Camelot.</p>
<p class='line'>Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;</p>
<p class='line'>For this dear child hath often heard me praise</p>
<p class='line'>Your feats of arms, and often when I paused&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>435</span></p>
<p class='line'>Had ask’d again, and ever loved to hear;</p>
<p class='line'>So grateful is the noise of noble deeds</p>
<p class='line'>To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:</p>
<p class='line'>Oh, never yet had woman such a pair</p>
<p class='line'>Of suitors as this maiden; first Limours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>440</span></p>
<p class='line'>A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,</p>
<p class='line'>Drunk even when he woo’d; and be he dead</p>
<p class='line'>I know not, but he pass’d to the wild land.</p>
<p class='line'>The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,</p>
<p class='line'>My curse, my nephew—I will not let his name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>445</span></p>
<p class='line'>Slip from my lips if I can help it—he,</p>
<p class='line'>When I that knew him fierce and turbulent</p>
<p class='line'>Refused her to him, then his pride awoke</p>
<p class='line'>And since the proud man often is the mean,</p>
<p class='line'>He sow’d a slander in the common ear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>450</span></p>
<p class='line'>Affirming that his father left him gold,</p>
<p class='line'>And in my charge, which was not render’d to him;</p>
<p class='line'>Bribed with large promises the men who serv’d</p>
<p class='line'>About my person, the more easily</p>
<p class='line'>Because my means were somewhat broken into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>455</span></p>
<p class='line'>Through open doors and hospitality;</p>
<p class='line'>Rais’d my own town against me in the night</p>
<p class='line'>Before my Enid’s birthday, sack’d my house;</p>
<p class='line'>From mine own earldom foully ousted me;</p>
<p class='line'>Built that new fort to overawe my friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>460</span></p>
<p class='line'>For truly there are those who love me yet;</p>
<p class='line'>And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,</p>
<p class='line'>Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,</p>
<p class='line'>But that his pride too much despises me:</p>
<p class='line'>And I myself sometimes despise myself;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>465</span></p>
<p class='line'>For I have let men be, and have their way;</p>
<p class='line'>Am much too gentle, have not used my power:</p>
<p class='line'>Nor know I whether I be very base</p>
<p class='line'>Or very manful, whether very wise</p>
<p class='line'>Or very foolish; only this I know,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>470</span></p>
<p class='line'>That whatsoever evil happen to me,</p>
<p class='line'>I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,</p>
<p class='line'>But can endure it all most patiently.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Well said, true heart,” replied Geraint, “but arms,</p>
<p class='line'>That if, as I suppose, your nephew fights&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>475</span></p>
<p class='line'>In next day’s tourney I may break his pride.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Yniol answer’d, “Arms, indeed, but old</p>
<p class='line'>And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,</p>
<p class='line'>Are mine, and therefore at your asking, yours.</p>
<p class='line'>But in this tournament can no man tilt,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>480</span></p>
<p class='line'>Except the lady he loves best be there.</p>
<p class='line'>Two forks are fix’d into the meadow ground,</p>
<p class='line'>And over these is laid a silver wand,</p>
<p class='line'>And over that is placed a sparrow-hawk,</p>
<p class='line'>The prize of beauty for the fairest there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>485</span></p>
<p class='line'>And this, what knight soever be in field</p>
<p class='line'>Lays claim to for the lady at his side,</p>
<p class='line'>And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,</p>
<p class='line'>Who being apt at arms and big of bone</p>
<p class='line'>Has ever won it for the lady with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>490</span></p>
<p class='line'>And toppling over all antagonism</p>
<p class='line'>Has earn’d himself the name of sparrow-hawk.</p>
<p class='line'>But you, that have no lady, cannot fight.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,</p>
<p class='line'>Leaning a little toward him, “Your leave!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>495</span></p>
<p class='line'>Let <span class='it'>me</span> lay lance in rest, O noble host,</p>
<p class='line'>For this dear child, because I never saw,</p>
<p class='line'>Though having seen all beauties of our time,</p>
<p class='line'>Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.</p>
<p class='line'>And if I fall her name will yet remain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>500</span></p>
<p class='line'>Untarnish’d as before; but if I live,</p>
<p class='line'>So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,</p>
<p class='line'>As I will make her truly my true wife.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Then, howsoever patient, Yniol’s heart</p>
<p class='line'>Danced in his bosom, seeing better days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>505</span></p>
<p class='line'>And looking round he saw not Enid there</p>
<p class='line'>(Who hearing her own name had slipt away),</p>
<p class='line'>But that old dame, to whom full tenderly</p>
<p class='line'>And fondling all her hand in his he said,</p>
<p class='line'>“Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>510</span></p>
<p class='line'>And best by her that bore her understood.</p>
<p class='line'>Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest</p>
<p class='line'>Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she</p>
<p class='line'>With frequent smile and nod departing found,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>515</span></p>
<p class='line'>Half-disarray’d as to her rest, the girl;</p>
<p class='line'>Whom first she kiss’d on either cheek, and then</p>
<p class='line'>On either shining shoulder laid a hand,</p>
<p class='line'>And kept her off and gazed upon her face,</p>
<p class='line'>And told her all their converse in the hall,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>520</span></p>
<p class='line'>Proving her heart: but never light and shade</p>
<p class='line'>Coursed one another more on open ground</p>
<p class='line'>Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale</p>
<p class='line'>Across the face of Enid hearing her;</p>
<p class='line'>While slowly falling as a scale that falls,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>525</span></p>
<p class='line'>When weight is added only grain by grain,</p>
<p class='line'>Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;</p>
<p class='line'>Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,</p>
<p class='line'>Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it.</p>
<p class='line'>So moving without answer to her rest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>530</span></p>
<p class='line'>She found no rest, and ever fail’d to draw</p>
<p class='line'>The quiet night into her blood, but lay</p>
<p class='line'>Contemplating her own unworthiness;</p>
<p class='line'>And when the pale and bloodless east began</p>
<p class='line'>To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>535</span></p>
<p class='line'>Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved</p>
<p class='line'>Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,</p>
<p class='line'>And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And thither came the twain, and when Geraint</p>
<p class='line'>Beheld her first in field awaiting him,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>540</span></p>
<p class='line'>He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,</p>
<p class='line'>Himself beyond the rest pushing could move</p>
<p class='line'>The chair of Idris. Yniol’s rusted arms</p>
<p class='line'>Were on his princely person, but through these</p>
<p class='line'>Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>545</span></p>
<p class='line'>And ladies came, and by and by the town</p>
<p class='line'>Flow’d in, and settling circled all the lists.</p>
<p class='line'>And there they fix’d the forks into the ground,</p>
<p class='line'>And over these they placed a silver wand,</p>
<p class='line'>And over that a golden sparrow-hawk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>550</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then Yniol’s nephew, after trumpet blown,</p>
<p class='line'>Spake to the lady with him and proclaim’d,</p>
<p class='line'>“Advance and take as fairest of the fair,</p>
<p class='line'>For I these two years past have won it for thee,</p>
<p class='line'>The prize of beauty.” Loudly spake the Prince,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>555</span></p>
<p class='line'>“Forbear; there is a worthier,” and the knight,</p>
<p class='line'>With some surprise and thrice as much disdain,</p>
<p class='line'>Turn’d, and beheld the four, and all his face</p>
<p class='line'>Glow’d like the heart of a great fire at Yule,</p>
<p class='line'>So burnt he was with passion, crying out,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>560</span></p>
<p class='line'>“Do battle for it then,” no more; and thrice</p>
<p class='line'>They clash’d together, and thrice they brake their spears.</p>
<p class='line'>Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lash’d at each</p>
<p class='line'>So often and with such blows, that all the crowd</p>
<p class='line'>Wonder’d, and now and then from distant walls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>565</span></p>
<p class='line'>There came a clapping as of phantom hands.</p>
<p class='line'>So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still</p>
<p class='line'>The dew of their great labour, and the blood</p>
<p class='line'>Of their strong bodies, flowing, drain’d their force.</p>
<p class='line'>But either’s force was match’d till Yniol’s cry,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>570</span></p>
<p class='line'>“Remember that great insult done the Queen,”</p>
<p class='line'>Increased Geraint’s, who heaved his blade aloft,</p>
<p class='line'>And crack’d the helmet through, and bit the bone,</p>
<p class='line'>And fell’d him, and set foot upon his breast,</p>
<p class='line'>And said, “Thy name?” To whom the fallen man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>575</span></p>
<p class='line'>Made answer, groaning, “Edyrn, son of Nudd!</p>
<p class='line'>Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.</p>
<p class='line'>My pride is broken: men have seen my fall.”</p>
<p class='line'>“Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,” replied Geraint,</p>
<p class='line'>“These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>580</span></p>
<p class='line'>First, thou thyself, thy lady, and thy dwarf,</p>
<p class='line'>Shalt ride to Arthur’s court, and being there,</p>
<p class='line'>Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,</p>
<p class='line'>And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,</p>
<p class='line'>Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>585</span></p>
<p class='line'>These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.”</p>
<p class='line'>And Edyrn answer’d, “These things will I do,</p>
<p class='line'>For I have never yet been overthrown,</p>
<p class='line'>And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride</p>
<p class='line'>Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>590</span></p>
<p class='line'>And rising up, he rode to Arthur’s court,</p>
<p class='line'>And there the Queen forgave him easily.</p>
<p class='line'>And being young, he changed himself, and grew</p>
<p class='line'>To hate the sin that seem’d so like his own</p>
<p class='line'>Of Modred, Arthur’s nephew, and fell at last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>595</span></p>
<p class='line'>In the great battle fighting for the King.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But when the third day from the hunting-morn</p>
<p class='line'>Made a low splendour in the world, and wings</p>
<p class='line'>Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay</p>
<p class='line'>With her fair head in the dim yellow light,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>600</span></p>
<p class='line'>Among the dancing shadows of the birds,</p>
<p class='line'>Woke and bethought her of her promise given</p>
<p class='line'>No later than last eve to Prince Geraint—</p>
<p class='line'>So bent he seem’d on going the third day,</p>
<p class='line'>He would not leave her, till her promise given—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>605</span></p>
<p class='line'>To ride with him this morning to the court,</p>
<p class='line'>And there be made known to the stately Queen,</p>
<p class='line'>And there be wedded with all ceremony.</p>
<p class='line'>At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,</p>
<p class='line'>And thought it never yet had look’d so mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>610</span></p>
<p class='line'>For as a leaf in mid-November is</p>
<p class='line'>To what it was in mid-October, seem’d</p>
<p class='line'>The dress that now she look’d on to the dress</p>
<p class='line'>She look’d on ere the coming of Geraint.</p>
<p class='line'>And still she look’d, and still the terror grew&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>615</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,</p>
<p class='line'>All staring at her in her faded silk;</p>
<p class='line'>And softly to her own sweet heart she said;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“This noble prince who won our earldom back,</p>
<p class='line'>So splendid in his acts and his attire,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>620</span></p>
<p class='line'>Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!</p>
<p class='line'>Would he could tarry with us here awhile,</p>
<p class='line'>But being so beholden to the Prince,</p>
<p class='line'>It were but little grace in any of us,</p>
<p class='line'>Bent as he seem’d on going this third day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>625</span></p>
<p class='line'>To seek a second favour at his hands.</p>
<p class='line'>Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,</p>
<p class='line'>Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,</p>
<p class='line'>Far liefer than so much discredit him.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Enid fell in longing for a dress&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>630</span></p>
<p class='line'>All branch’d and flower’d with gold, a costly gift</p>
<p class='line'>Of her good mother, given her on the night</p>
<p class='line'>Before her birthday, three sad years ago,</p>
<p class='line'>That night of fire, when Edyrn sack’d their house,</p>
<p class='line'>And scatter’d all they had to all the winds:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>635</span></p>
<p class='line'>For while the mother show’d it, and the two</p>
<p class='line'>Were turning and admiring it, the work</p>
<p class='line'>To both appear’d so costly, rose a cry</p>
<p class='line'>That Edyrn’s men were on them, and they fled</p>
<p class='line'>With little save the jewels they had on,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>640</span></p>
<p class='line'>Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:</p>
<p class='line'>And Edyrn’s men had caught them in their flight,</p>
<p class='line'>And placed them in this ruin; and she wish’d</p>
<p class='line'>The Prince had found her in her ancient home;</p>
<p class='line'>Then let her fancy flit across the past,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>645</span></p>
<p class='line'>And roam the goodly places that she knew;</p>
<p class='line'>And last bethought her how she used to watch,</p>
<p class='line'>Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;</p>
<p class='line'>And one was patch’d and blurr’d and lustreless</p>
<p class='line'>Among his burnish’d brethren of the pool;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>650</span></p>
<p class='line'>And half asleep she made comparison</p>
<p class='line'>Of that and these to her own faded self</p>
<p class='line'>And the gay court, and fell asleep again;</p>
<p class='line'>And dreamt herself was such a faded form</p>
<p class='line'>Among her burnish’d sisters of the pool;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>655</span></p>
<p class='line'>But this was in the garden of a king;</p>
<p class='line'>And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew</p>
<p class='line'>That all was bright; that all about were birds</p>
<p class='line'>Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;</p>
<p class='line'>That all the turf was rich in plots that look’d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>660</span></p>
<p class='line'>Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;</p>
<p class='line'>And lords and ladies of the high court went</p>
<p class='line'>In silver tissue talking things of state;</p>
<p class='line'>And children of the King in cloth of gold</p>
<p class='line'>Glanced at the doors or gamboll’d down the walks;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>665</span></p>
<p class='line'>And while she thought, “They will not see me,” came</p>
<p class='line'>A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,</p>
<p class='line'>And all the children in their cloth of gold</p>
<p class='line'>Ran to her, crying, “If we have fish at all</p>
<p class='line'>Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>670</span></p>
<p class='line'>To pick the faded creature from the pool.</p>
<p class='line'>And cast it on the mixen that it die.”</p>
<p class='line'>And therewithal one came and seized on her,</p>
<p class='line'>And Enid started, waking, with her heart</p>
<p class='line'>All overshadow’d by the foolish dream,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>675</span></p>
<p class='line'>And lo! it was her mother grasping her</p>
<p class='line'>To get her well awake: and in her hand</p>
<p class='line'>A suit of bright apparel, which she laid</p>
<p class='line'>Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>680</span></p>
<p class='line'>How fast they hold like colours of a shell</p>
<p class='line'>That keeps the wear and polish of the wave!</p>
<p class='line'>Why not? It never yet was worn, I trow:</p>
<p class='line'>Look on it, child, and tell me if you know it.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Enid look’d, but all confus’d at first,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>685</span></p>
<p class='line'>Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream;</p>
<p class='line'>Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,</p>
<p class='line'>And answer’d, “Yea, I know it; your good gift,</p>
<p class='line'>So sadly lost on that unhappy night;</p>
<p class='line'>Your own good gift!” “Yea, surely,” said the dame,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>690</span></p>
<p class='line'>“And gladly given again this happy morn.</p>
<p class='line'>For when the jousts were ended yesterday,</p>
<p class='line'>Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere</p>
<p class='line'>He found the sack and plunder of our house</p>
<p class='line'>All scatter’d through the houses of the town;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>695</span></p>
<p class='line'>And gave command that all which once was ours</p>
<p class='line'>Should now be ours again: and yester-eve,</p>
<p class='line'>While you were talking sweetly with your Prince,</p>
<p class='line'>Came one with this and laid it in my hand,</p>
<p class='line'>For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>700</span></p>
<p class='line'>Because we have our Earldom back again.</p>
<p class='line'>And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,</p>
<p class='line'>But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.</p>
<p class='line'>Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?</p>
<p class='line'>For I myself unwillingly have worn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>705</span></p>
<p class='line'>My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,</p>
<p class='line'>And howsoever patient, Yniol his.</p>
<p class='line'>Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,</p>
<p class='line'>With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,</p>
<p class='line'>And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>710</span></p>
<p class='line'>And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all</p>
<p class='line'>That appertains to noble maintenance.</p>
<p class='line'>Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;</p>
<p class='line'>But since our fortune slipt from sun to shade,</p>
<p class='line'>And all through that young traitor, cruel need&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>715</span></p>
<p class='line'>Constrain’d us, but a better time has come;</p>
<p class='line'>So clothe yourself in this, that better fits</p>
<p class='line'>Our mended fortunes and a Prince’s bride:</p>
<p class='line'>For though you won the prize of fairest fair,</p>
<p class='line'>And though I heard him call you fairest fair,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>720</span></p>
<p class='line'>Let never maiden think, however fair,</p>
<p class='line'>She is not fairer in new clothes than old.</p>
<p class='line'>And should some great court-lady say, the Prince</p>
<p class='line'>Hath pick’d a ragged-robin from the hedge,</p>
<p class='line'>And like a madman brought her to the court,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>725</span></p>
<p class='line'>Then were you shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince</p>
<p class='line'>To whom we are beholden; but I know,</p>
<p class='line'>When my dear child is set forth at her best,</p>
<p class='line'>That neither court nor country, though they sought</p>
<p class='line'>Through all the provinces like those of old&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>730</span></p>
<p class='line'>That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;</p>
<p class='line'>And Enid listen’d brightening as she lay;</p>
<p class='line'>Then, as the white and glittering star of morn</p>
<p class='line'>Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>735</span></p>
<p class='line'>Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,</p>
<p class='line'>And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,</p>
<p class='line'>Help’d by the mother’s careful hand and eye,</p>
<p class='line'>Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;</p>
<p class='line'>Who, after, turn’d her daughter round and said,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>740</span></p>
<p class='line'>She never yet had seen her half so fair;</p>
<p class='line'>And call’d her like that maiden in the tale,</p>
<p class='line'>Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers,</p>
<p class='line'>And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,</p>
<p class='line'>Flur, for whose love the Roman Cæsar first&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>745</span></p>
<p class='line'>Invaded Britain, “But we beat him back,</p>
<p class='line'>As this great Prince invaded us, and we,</p>
<p class='line'>Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy.</p>
<p class='line'>And I can scarcely ride with you to court,</p>
<p class='line'>For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>750</span></p>
<p class='line'>But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream</p>
<p class='line'>I see my princess as I see her now,</p>
<p class='line'>Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint</p>
<p class='line'>Woke where he slept in the high hall, and call’d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>755</span></p>
<p class='line'>For Enid; and when Yniol made report</p>
<p class='line'>Of that good mother making Enid gay</p>
<p class='line'>In such apparel as might well beseem</p>
<p class='line'>His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,</p>
<p class='line'>He answer’d: “Earl, entreat her by my love,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>760</span></p>
<p class='line'>Albeit I give no reason but my wish,</p>
<p class='line'>That she ride with me in her faded silk.”</p>
<p class='line'>Yniol with that hard message went; it fell</p>
<p class='line'>Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:</p>
<p class='line'>For Enid, all abash’d she knew not why,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>765</span></p>
<p class='line'>Dared not to glance at her good mother’s face,</p>
<p class='line'>But silently, in all obedience,</p>
<p class='line'>Her mother silent too, nor helping her,</p>
<p class='line'>Laid from her limbs the costly-broider’d gift,</p>
<p class='line'>And robed them in her ancient suit again,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>770</span></p>
<p class='line'>And so descended. Never man rejoiced</p>
<p class='line'>More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;</p>
<p class='line'>And glancing all at once as keenly at her</p>
<p class='line'>As careful robins eye the delver’s toil,</p>
<p class='line'>Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>775</span></p>
<p class='line'>But rested with her sweet face satisfied;</p>
<p class='line'>Then seeing cloud upon the mother’s brow,</p>
<p class='line'>Her by both hands he caught, and sweetly said:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved</p>
<p class='line'>At your new son, for my petition to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>780</span></p>
<p class='line'>When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,</p>
<p class='line'>In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,</p>
<p class='line'>Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,</p>
<p class='line'>Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.</p>
<p class='line'>Thereafter, when I reach’d this ruin’d hold,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>785</span></p>
<p class='line'>Beholding one so bright in dark estate,</p>
<p class='line'>I vow’d that could I gain her, our kind Queen,</p>
<p class='line'>No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst</p>
<p class='line'>Sunlike from cloud—and likewise thought, perhaps,</p>
<p class='line'>That service done so graciously would bind&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>790</span></p>
<p class='line'>The two together; for I wish the two</p>
<p class='line'>To love each other: how should Enid find</p>
<p class='line'>A nobler friend? Another thought I had;</p>
<p class='line'>I came among you here so suddenly,</p>
<p class='line'>That though her gentle presence at the lists&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>795</span></p>
<p class='line'>Might well have served for proof that I was loved,</p>
<p class='line'>I doubted whether filial tenderness,</p>
<p class='line'>Or easy nature, did not let itself</p>
<p class='line'>Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;</p>
<p class='line'>Or whether some false sense in her own self&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>800</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of my contrasting brightness, overbore</p>
<p class='line'>Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;</p>
<p class='line'>And such a sense might make her long for court</p>
<p class='line'>And all its dangerous glories: and I thought,</p>
<p class='line'>That could I someway prove such force in her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>805</span></p>
<p class='line'>Link’d with such love for me, that at a word</p>
<p class='line'>(No reason given her) she could cast aside</p>
<p class='line'>A splendour dear to women, new to her,</p>
<p class='line'>And therefore dearer; or if not so new,</p>
<p class='line'>Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>810</span></p>
<p class='line'>Of intermitted custom; then I felt</p>
<p class='line'>That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,</p>
<p class='line'>Fix’d on her faith. Now, therefore, I do rest,</p>
<p class='line'>A prophet certain of my prophecy,</p>
<p class='line'>That never shadow of mistrust can cross&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>815</span></p>
<p class='line'>Between us. Grant me pardon for my thoughts;</p>
<p class='line'>And for my strange petition I will make</p>
<p class='line'>Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,</p>
<p class='line'>When your fair child shall wear your costly gift</p>
<p class='line'>Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>820</span></p>
<p class='line'>Who knows? another gift of the high God,</p>
<p class='line'>Which, maybe, shall have learn’d to lisp you thanks.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He spoke: the mother smil’d, but half in tears,</p>
<p class='line'>Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,</p>
<p class='line'>And claspt and kiss’d her, and they rode away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>825</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climb’d</p>
<p class='line'>The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,</p>
<p class='line'>Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,</p>
<p class='line'>And white sails flying on the yellow sea;</p>
<p class='line'>But not to goodly hill or yellow sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>830</span></p>
<p class='line'>Look’d the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,</p>
<p class='line'>By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;</p>
<p class='line'>And then descending met them at the gates,</p>
<p class='line'>Embrac’d her with all welcome as a friend,</p>
<p class='line'>And did her honour as the Prince’s bride,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>835</span></p>
<p class='line'>And cloth’d her for her bridals like the sun;</p>
<p class='line'>And all that week was old Caerleon gay,</p>
<p class='line'>For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,</p>
<p class='line'>They twain were wedded with all ceremony.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And this was on the last year’s Whitsuntide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>840</span></p>
<p class='line'>But Enid ever kept the faded silk,</p>
<p class='line'>Remembering how first he came on her,</p>
<p class='line'>Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,</p>
<p class='line'>And all her foolish fears about the dress,</p>
<p class='line'>And all his journey toward her, as himself&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>845</span></p>
<p class='line'>Had told her, and their coming to the court.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And now this morning when he said to her,</p>
<p class='line'>“Put on your worst and meanest dress,” she found</p>
<p class='line'>And took it, and array’d herself therein.</p>

<p class='line'>He that gain’d a hundred fights,</p>

<p class='line'>Against the myriads of Assaye</p>
<p class='line'>Clash’d with his fiery few and won;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>100</span></p>
<p class='line'>And underneath another sun,</p>
<p class='line'>Warring on a later day,</p>
<p class='line'>Round affrighted Lisbon drew</p>
<p class='line'>The treble works, the vast designs</p>
<p class='line'>Of his labour’d rampart-lines,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>105</span></p>
<p class='line'>Where he greatly stood at bay,</p>
<p class='line'>Whence he issued forth anew,</p>
<p class='line'>And ever great and greater grew</p>
<p class='line'>Beating from the wasted vines</p>
<p class='line'>Back to France her banded swarms,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>110</span></p>
<p class='line'>Back to France with countless blows,</p>
<p class='line'>Till o’er the hills her eagles flew</p>
<p class='line'>Beyond the Pyrenean pines,</p>
<p class='line'>Follow’d up in valley and glen</p>
<p class='line'>With blare of bugle, clamour of men,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>115</span></p>
<p class='line'>Roll of cannon and clash of arms,</p>
<p class='line'>And England pouring on her foes.</p>

<p class='line'>Again their ravening eagle rose</p>

<p class='line'>And barking for the thrones of kings;</p>
<p class='line'>Till one that sought but Duty’s iron crown</p>
<p class='line'>On that loud sabbath shook the spoiler down;</p>
<p class='line'>A day of onsets of despair!</p>
<p class='line'>Dash’d on every rocky square&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>125</span></p>

<p class='line'>Not once or twice in our rough island-story,</p>

<p class='line'>Love of self, before his journey closes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>205</span></p>
<p class='line'>He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting</p>

<p class='line'>He, that ever following her commands,</p>

<p class='line'>By some yet unmoulded tongue</p>
<p class='line'>Far on in summers that we shall not see:</p>
<p class='line'>Peace, it is a day of pain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>235</span></p>
<p class='line'>For one about whose patriarchal knee</p>

<p class='line'>Once the weight and fate of Europe hung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>240</span></p>
<p class='line'>Ours the pain, be his the gain!</p>
<p class='line'>More than is of man’s degree</p>
<p class='line'>Must be with us, watching here</p>

<p class='line'>Whom we see not we revere;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>245</span></p>
<p class='line'>We revere, and we refrain</p>
<p class='line'>From talk of battles loud and vain,</p>
<p class='line'>And brawling memories all too free</p>
<p class='line'>For such a wise humility</p>
<p class='line'>As befits a solemn fane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>250</span></p>
<p class='line'>We revere, and while we hear</p>
<p class='line'>The tides of Music’s golden sea</p>
<p class='line'>Setting toward eternity,</p>

<p class='line'>There must be other nobler work to do</p>
<p class='line'>Than when he fought at Waterloo,</p>

<p class='line'>And break the shore, and evermore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>260</span></p>
<p class='line'>Make and break, and work their will;</p>
<p class='line'>Tho’ world on world in myriad myriads roll</p>
<p class='line'>Round us, each with different powers,</p>

<p class='line'>On God and Godlike men we build our trust.</p>
<p class='line'>Hush, the Dead March wails in the people’s ears:</p>

<p class='line'>Ashes to ashes, dust to dust;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>270</span></p>
<p class='line'>He is gone who seem’d so great,—</p>
<p class='line'>Gone; but nothing can bereave him</p>
<p class='line'>Of the force he made his own</p>
<p class='line'>Being here, and we believe him</p>
<p class='line'>Something far advanced in State,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>275</span></p>
<p class='line'>And that he wears a truer crown</p>
<p class='line'>Than any wreath that man can weave him.</p>
<p class='line'>Speak no more of his renown,</p>
<p class='line'>Lay your earthly fancies down,</p>
<p class='line'>And in the vast cathedral leave him,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>280</span></p>

<p class='line'>Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,</p>
<p class='line'>And thanks his gods for all the good they gave.</p>
<p class='line'>Such is the patriot’s boast, where’er we roam;</p>
<p class='line'>His first, best country ever is at home.</p>
<p class='line'>And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>75</span></p>
<p class='line'>And estimate the blessings which they share,</p>
<p class='line'>Though patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find</p>
<p class='line'>An equal portion dealt to all mankind;</p>
<p class='line'>As different good, by art or nature given,</p>
<p class='line'>To different nations makes their blessings even.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>80</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Nature, a mother kind alike to all,</p>
<p class='line'>Still grants her bliss at labour’s earnest call;</p>
<p class='line'>With food as well the peasant is supplied</p>
<p class='line'>On Idra’s cliffs as Arno’s shelvy side;</p>
<p class='line'>And, though the rocky-crested summits frown,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>85</span></p>
<p class='line'>These rocks by custom turn to beds of down.</p>
<p class='line'>From art more various are the blessings sent:</p>
<p class='line'>Wealth, commerce, honour, liberty, content.</p>
<p class='line'>Yet these each other’s power so strong contest,</p>
<p class='line'>That either seems destructive of the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>90</span></p>
<p class='line'>Where wealth and freedom reign, contentment fails,</p>
<p class='line'>And honour sinks where commerce long prevails.</p>
<p class='line'>Hence every state, to one lov’d blessing prone,</p>
<p class='line'>Conforms and models life to that alone;</p>
<p class='line'>Each to the favourite happiness attends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>95</span></p>
<p class='line'>And spurns the plan that aims at other ends;</p>
<p class='line'>Till, carried to excess in each domain,</p>
<p class='line'>This favourite good begets peculiar pain.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But let us try these truths with closer eyes,</p>
<p class='line'>And trace them through the prospect as it lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>100</span></p>
<p class='line'>Here for a while, my proper cares resign’d,</p>
<p class='line'>Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind;</p>
<p class='line'>Like yon neglected shrub, at random cast,</p>
<p class='line'>That shades the steep, and sighs at every blast.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Far to the right, where Apennine ascends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>105</span></p>
<p class='line'>Bright as the summer, Italy extends;</p>
<p class='line'>Its uplands sloping deck the mountain’s side,</p>
<p class='line'>Woods over woods in gay theatric pride;</p>
<p class='line'>While oft some temple’s mouldering tops between</p>
<p class='line'>With venerable grandeur mark the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>110</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Could nature’s bounty satisfy the breast,</p>
<p class='line'>The sons of Italy were surely blest.</p>
<p class='line'>Whatever fruits in different climes are found,</p>
<p class='line'>That proudly rise, or humbly court the ground;</p>
<p class='line'>Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>115</span></p>
<p class='line'>Whose bright succession decks the varied year;</p>
<p class='line'>Whatever sweets salute the northern sky</p>
<p class='line'>With vernal lives, that blossom but to die;</p>
<p class='line'>These, here disporting, own the kindred soil,</p>
<p class='line'>Nor ask luxuriance from the planter’s toil;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>120</span></p>
<p class='line'>While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand</p>
<p class='line'>To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,</p>
<p class='line'>And sensual bliss is all this nation knows.</p>
<p class='line'>In florid beauty groves and fields appear,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>125</span></p>
<p class='line'>Man seems the only growth that dwindles here.</p>
<p class='line'>Contrasted faults through all his manners reign:</p>
<p class='line'>Though poor, luxurious; though submissive, vain;</p>
<p class='line'>Though grave, yet trifling; zealous, yet untrue;</p>
<p class='line'>And even in penance planning sins anew.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>130</span></p>
<p class='line'>All evils here contaminate the mind,</p>
<p class='line'>That opulence departed leaves behind;</p>
<p class='line'>For wealth was theirs, not far remov’d the date,</p>
<p class='line'>When commerce proudly flourished through the state.</p>
<p class='line'>At her command the palace learnt to rise,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>135</span></p>
<p class='line'>Again the long-fallen column sought the skies;</p>
<p class='line'>The canvas glow’d beyond ev’n nature warm,</p>
<p class='line'>The pregnant quarry teem’d with human form;</p>
<p class='line'>Till, more unsteady than the southern gale,</p>
<p class='line'>Commerce on other shores display’d her sail;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>140</span></p>
<p class='line'>While nought remain’d of all that riches gave,</p>
<p class='line'>But towns unmann’d, and lords without a slave:</p>
<p class='line'>And late the nation found, with fruitless skill,</p>
<p class='line'>Its former strength was but plethoric ill.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>145</span></p>
<p class='line'>By arts, the splendid wrecks of former pride;</p>
<p class='line'>From these the feeble heart and long-fallen mind</p>
<p class='line'>An easy compensation seem to find.</p>
<p class='line'>Here may be seen, in bloodless pomp array’d,</p>
<p class='line'>The pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>150</span></p>
<p class='line'>Processions form’d for piety and love,</p>
<p class='line'>A mistress or a saint in every grove.</p>
<p class='line'>By sports like these are all their cares beguil’d,</p>
<p class='line'>The sports of children satisfy the child;</p>
<p class='line'>Each nobler aim, represt by long control,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>155</span></p>
<p class='line'>Now sinks at last, or feebly mans the soul;</p>
<p class='line'>While low delights, succeeding fast behind,</p>
<p class='line'>In happier meanness occupy the mind.</p>
<p class='line'>As in those domes where Cæsars once bore sway,</p>
<p class='line'>Defac’d by time and tottering in decay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>160</span></p>
<p class='line'>There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,</p>
<p class='line'>The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed;</p>
<p class='line'>And, wondering man could want the larger pile,</p>
<p class='line'>Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;My soul, turn from them; turn we to survey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>165</span></p>
<p class='line'><a id='where'></a>Where rougher climes a nobler race display;</p>
<p class='line'>Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansion tread,</p>
<p class='line'>And force a churlish soil for scanty bread.</p>
<p class='line'>No product here the barren hills afford,</p>
<p class='line'>But man and steel, the soldier and his sword;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>170</span></p>
<p class='line'>No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array,</p>
<p class='line'>But winter lingering chills the lap of May;</p>
<p class='line'>No zephyr fondly sues the mountain’s breast,</p>
<p class='line'>But meteors glare, and stormy glooms invest.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Yet still, even here, content can spread a charm,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>175</span></p>
<p class='line'>Redress the clime, and all its rage disarm.</p>
<p class='line'>Though poor the peasant’s hut, his feasts though small,</p>
<p class='line'>He sees his little lot the lot of all;</p>
<p class='line'>Sees no contiguous palace rear its head</p>
<p class='line'>To shame the meanness of his humble shed;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>180</span></p>
<p class='line'>No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal</p>
<p class='line'>To make him loathe his vegetable meal;</p>
<p class='line'>But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,</p>
<p class='line'>Each wish contracting, fits him to the soil.</p>
<p class='line'>Cheerful, at morn, he wakes from short repose,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>185</span></p>
<p class='line'>Breasts the keen air, and carols as he goes;</p>
<p class='line'>With patient angle trolls the finny deep,</p>
<p class='line'>Or drives his venturous plowshare to the steep;</p>
<p class='line'>Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way,</p>
<p class='line'>And drags the struggling savage into day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>190</span></p>
<p class='line'>At night returning, every labour sped,</p>
<p class='line'>He sits him down, the monarch of a shed;</p>
<p class='line'>Smiles by his cheerful fire, and round surveys</p>
<p class='line'>His children’s looks, that brighten at the blaze,</p>
<p class='line'>While his lov’d partner, boastful of her hoard,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>195</span></p>
<p class='line'>Displays her cleanly platter on the board;</p>
<p class='line'>And haply too some pilgrim, thither led,</p>
<p class='line'>With many a tale repays the nightly bed.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thus every good his native wilds impart,</p>
<p class='line'>Imprints the patriot passion on his heart;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>200</span></p>
<p class='line'>And ev’n those hills that round his mansion rise</p>
<p class='line'>Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies.</p>
<p class='line'>Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,</p>
<p class='line'>And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms:</p>
<p class='line'>And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>205</span></p>
<p class='line'>Clings close and closer to the mother’s breast,</p>
<p class='line'>So the loud torrent and the whirlwind’s roar</p>
<p class='line'>But bind him to his native mountains more.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Such are the charms to barren states assign’d:</p>
<p class='line'>Their wants but few, their wishes all confin’d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>210</span></p>
<p class='line'>Yet let them only share the praises due;</p>
<p class='line'>If few their wants, their pleasures are but few;</p>
<p class='line'>For every want that stimulates the breast</p>
<p class='line'>Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest.</p>
<p class='line'>Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>215</span></p>
<p class='line'>That first excites desire, and then supplies;</p>
<p class='line'>Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy,</p>
<p class='line'>To fill the languid pause with finer joy;</p>
<p class='line'>Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame</p>
<p class='line'>Catch every nerve, and vibrate through the frame:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>220</span></p>
<p class='line'>Their level life is but a smouldering fire,</p>
<p class='line'>Unquench’d by want, unfann’d by strong desire;</p>
<p class='line'>Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer</p>
<p class='line'>On some high festival of once a year,</p>
<p class='line'>In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>225</span></p>
<p class='line'>Till, buried in debauch, the bliss expire.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow;</p>
<p class='line'>Their morals, like their pleasures, are but low.</p>
<p class='line'>For, as refinement stops, from sire to son,</p>
<p class='line'>Unalter’d, unimprov’d, the manners run;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>230</span></p>
<p class='line'>And love’s and friendship’s finely pointed dart</p>
<p class='line'>Fall blunted from each indurated heart.</p>
<p class='line'>Some sterner virtues o’er the mountain’s breast</p>
<p class='line'>May sit, like falcons cowering on the nest;</p>
<p class='line'>But all the gentler morals, such as play&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>235</span></p>
<p class='line'>Through life’s more cultur’d walks, and charm the way,—</p>
<p class='line'>These, far dispers’d, on timorous pinions fly,</p>
<p class='line'>To sport and flutter in a kinder sky.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign,</p>
<p class='line'>I turn; and France displays her bright domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>240</span></p>
<p class='line'>Gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease,</p>
<p class='line'>Pleas’d with thyself, whom all the world can please,</p>
<p class='line'>How often have I led thy sportive choir,</p>
<p class='line'>With tuneless pipe, beside the murmuring Loire!</p>
<p class='line'>Where shading elms along the margin grew,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>245</span></p>
<p class='line'>And freshen’d from the wave the zephyr flew;</p>
<p class='line'>And haply, though my harsh touch, faltering still,</p>
<p class='line'>But mock’d all tune, and marr’d the dancer’s skill,</p>
<p class='line'>Yet would the village praise my wondrous power,</p>
<p class='line'>And dance, forgetful of the noontide hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>250</span></p>
<p class='line'>Alike all ages: dames of ancient days</p>
<p class='line'>Have led their children through the mirthful maze;</p>
<p class='line'>And the gay grandsire, skill’d in gestic lore,</p>
<p class='line'>Has frisk’d beneath the burthen of threescore.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;So blest a life these thoughtless realms display;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>255</span></p>
<p class='line'>Thus idly busy rolls their world away.</p>
<p class='line'>Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,</p>
<p class='line'>For honour forms the social temper here:</p>
<p class='line'>Honour, that praise which real merit gains,</p>
<p class='line'>Or even imaginary worth obtains,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>260</span></p>
<p class='line'>Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,</p>
<p class='line'>It shifts in splendid traffic round the land;</p>
<p class='line'>From courts, to camps, to cottages it strays,</p>
<p class='line'>And all are taught an avarice of praise.</p>
<p class='line'>They please, are pleas’d; they give to get esteem,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>265</span></p>
<p class='line'>Till, seeming blest, they grow to what they seem.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But while this softer art their bliss supplies,</p>
<p class='line'>It gives their follies also room to rise;</p>
<p class='line'>For praise too dearly lov’d, or warmly sought</p>
<p class='line'>Enfeebles all internal strength of thought:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>270</span></p>
<p class='line'>And the weak soul, within itself unblest,</p>
<p class='line'>Leans for all pleasure on another’s breast.</p>
<p class='line'>Hence ostentation here, with tawdry art,</p>
<p class='line'>Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;</p>
<p class='line'>Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>275</span></p>
<p class='line'>And trims her robes of frieze with copper lace;</p>
<p class='line'>Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,</p>
<p class='line'>To boast one splendid banquet once a year:</p>
<p class='line'>The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,</p>
<p class='line'>Nor weighs the solid worth of self-applause.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>280</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To men of other minds my fancy flies,</p>
<p class='line'>Embosom’d in the deep where Holland lies.</p>
<p class='line'>Methinks her patient sons before me stand,</p>
<p class='line'>Where the broad ocean leans against the land,</p>
<p class='line'>And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>285</span></p>
<p class='line'>Lift the tall rampire’s artificial pride.</p>
<p class='line'>Onward methinks, and diligently slow,</p>
<p class='line'>The firm connected bulwark seems to grow,</p>
<p class='line'>Spreads its long arms amidst the watery roar,</p>
<p class='line'>Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>290</span></p>
<p class='line'>While the pent ocean, rising o’er the pile,</p>
<p class='line'>Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile:</p>
<p class='line'>The slow canal, the yellow-blossom’d vale,</p>
<p class='line'>The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,</p>
<p class='line'>The crowded mart, the cultivated plain,—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>295</span></p>
<p class='line'>A new creation rescued from his reign.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thus, while around the wave-subjected soil</p>
<p class='line'>Impels the native to repeated toil,</p>
<p class='line'>Industrious habits in each bosom reign,</p>
<p class='line'>And industry begets a love of gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>300</span></p>
<p class='line'>Hence all the good from opulence that springs,</p>
<p class='line'>With all those ills superfluous treasure brings,</p>
<p class='line'>Are here display’d. Their much lov’d wealth imparts</p>
<p class='line'>Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;</p>
<p class='line'>But, view them closer, craft and fraud appear;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>305</span></p>
<p class='line'>Even liberty itself is bartered here.</p>
<p class='line'>At gold’s superior charms all freedom flies;</p>
<p class='line'>The needy sell it, and the rich man buys.</p>
<p class='line'>A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,</p>
<p class='line'>Here wretches seek dishonorable graves,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>310</span></p>
<p class='line'>And calmly bent, to servitude conform,</p>
<p class='line'>Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Heavens! how unlike their Belgic sires of old—</p>
<p class='line'>Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold;</p>
<p class='line'>War in each breast, and freedom on each brow;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>315</span></p>
<p class='line'>How much unlike the sons of Britain now!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Fir’d at the sound, my genius spreads her wing,</p>
<p class='line'>And flies where Britain courts the western spring,</p>
<p class='line'>Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride,</p>
<p class='line'>And brighter streams than fam’d Hydaspes glide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>320</span></p>
<p class='line'>There all around the gentlest breezes stray,</p>
<p class='line'>There gentle music melts on every spray;</p>
<p class='line'>Creation’s mildest charms are there combin’d:</p>
<p class='line'>Extremes are only in the master’s mind!</p>
<p class='line'>Stern o’er each bosom reason holds her state,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>325</span></p>
<p class='line'>With daring aims irregularly great;</p>
<p class='line'>Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,</p>
<p class='line'>I see the lords of human kind pass by;</p>
<p class='line'>Intent on high designs, a thoughtful band,</p>
<p class='line'>By forms unfashion’d, fresh from Nature’s hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>330</span></p>
<p class='line'>Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,</p>
<p class='line'>True to imagin’d right, above control;</p>
<p class='line'>While e’en the peasant boasts these rights to scan,</p>
<p class='line'>And learns to venerate himself as man.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thine, Freedom, thine the blessings pictur’d here,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>335</span></p>
<p class='line'>Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear;</p>
<p class='line'>Too blest, indeed, were such without alloy;</p>
<p class='line'>But, foster’d e’en by freedom, ills annoy.</p>
<p class='line'>That independence Britons prize too high</p>
<p class='line'>Keeps man from man, and breaks the social tie;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>340</span></p>
<p class='line'>The self-dependent lordlings stand alone,</p>
<p class='line'>All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown.</p>
<p class='line'>Here, by the bonds of nature feebly held,</p>
<p class='line'>Minds combat minds, repelling and repell’d;</p>
<p class='line'>Ferments arise, imprison’d factions roar,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>345</span></p>
<p class='line'>Represt ambition struggles round her shore;</p>
<p class='line'>Till, over-wrought, the general system feels</p>
<p class='line'>Its motions stop, or frenzy fire the wheels.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Nor this the worst. As nature’s ties decay,</p>
<p class='line'>As duty, love, and <a id='honour'></a>honour fail to sway,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>350</span></p>
<p class='line'>Fictitious bonds, the bonds of wealth and law,</p>
<p class='line'>Still gather strength, and force unwilling awe.</p>
<p class='line'>Hence all obedience bows to these alone,</p>
<p class='line'>And talent sinks, and merit weeps unknown;</p>
<p class='line'>Till time may come, when, stript of all her charms,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>355</span></p>
<p class='line'>The land of scholars, and the nurse of arms,</p>
<p class='line'>Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame,</p>
<p class='line'>Where kings have toil’d and poets wrote for fame,</p>
<p class='line'>One sink of level avarice shall lie,</p>
<p class='line'>And scholars, soldiers, kings, unhonour’d die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>360</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Yet think not, thus when Freedom’s ills I state,</p>
<p class='line'>I mean to flatter kings, or court the great:</p>
<p class='line'>Ye powers of truth, that bid my soul aspire,</p>
<p class='line'>Far from my bosom drive the low desire;</p>
<p class='line'>And thou, fair Freedom, taught alike to feel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>365</span></p>
<p class='line'>The rabble’s rage, and tyrant’s angry steel;</p>
<p class='line'>Thou transitory flower, alike undone</p>
<p class='line'>By proud contempt, or favour’s fostering sun,</p>
<p class='line'>Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure!</p>
<p class='line'>I only would repress them to secure:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>370</span></p>
<p class='line'>For just experience tells in every soil,</p>
<p class='line'>That those who think must govern those who toil;</p>
<p class='line'>And all that Freedom’s highest aims can reach,</p>
<p class='line'>Is but to lay proportion’d loads on each.</p>
<p class='line'>Hence, should one order disproportioned grow,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>375</span></p>
<p class='line'>Its double weight must ruin all below.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Oh, then how blind to all that truth requires,</p>
<p class='line'>Who think it freedom when a part aspires!</p>
<p class='line'>Calm is my soul, nor apt to rise in arms,</p>
<p class='line'>Except when fast approaching danger warms:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>380</span></p>
<p class='line'>But when contending chiefs blockade the throne,</p>
<p class='line'>Contracting regal power to stretch their own;</p>
<p class='line'>When I behold a factious band agree</p>
<p class='line'>To call it freedom when themselves are free;</p>
<p class='line'>Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>385</span></p>
<p class='line'>Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the law;</p>
<p class='line'>The wealth of climes where savage nations roam,</p>
<p class='line'>Pillag’d from slaves to purchase slaves at home;</p>
<p class='line'>Fear, pity, justice, indignation, start,</p>
<p class='line'>Tear off reserve, and bare my swelling heart;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>390</span></p>
<p class='line'>Till, half a patriot, half a coward grown,</p>
<p class='line'>I fly from petty tyrants to the throne.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Yes, brother, curse with me that baleful hour,</p>
<p class='line'>When first ambition struck at regal power,</p>
<p class='line'>And thus polluting honour in its source,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>395</span></p>
<p class='line'>Gave wealth to sway the mind with double force.</p>
<p class='line'>Have we not seen, round Britain’s peopled shore,</p>
<p class='line'>Her useful sons exchang’d for useless ore?</p>
<p class='line'>Seen all her triumphs but destruction haste,</p>
<p class='line'>Like flaring tapers brightening as they waste,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>400</span></p>
<p class='line'>Seen opulence, her grandeur to maintain,</p>
<p class='line'>Lead stern depopulation in her train,</p>
<p class='line'>And over fields where scatter’d hamlets rose,</p>
<p class='line'>In barren, solitary pomp repose?</p>
<p class='line'>Have we not seen, at pleasure’s lordly call,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>405</span></p>
<p class='line'>The smiling, long frequented village fall?</p>
<p class='line'>Behold the duteous son, the sire decay’d,</p>
<p class='line'>The modest matron, and the blushing maid,</p>
<p class='line'>Forc’d from their homes, a melancholy train,</p>
<p class='line'>To traverse climes beyond the western main;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>410</span></p>
<p class='line'>Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around,</p>
<p class='line'>And Niagara stuns with thundering sound?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Even now, perhaps, as there some pilgrim strays</p>
<p class='line'>Through tangled forests, and through dangerous ways,</p>
<p class='line'>Where beasts with man divided empire claim,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>415</span></p>
<p class='line'>And the brown Indian marks with murderous aim;</p>
<p class='line'>There, while above the giddy tempest flies,</p>
<p class='line'>And all around distressful yells arise,</p>
<p class='line'>The pensive exile, bending with his woe,</p>
<p class='line'>To stop too fearful, and too faint to go,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>420</span></p>
<p class='line'>Casts a long look where England’s glories shine,</p>
<p class='line'>And bids his bosom sympathize with mine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Vain, very vain, my weary search to find</p>
<p class='line'>That bliss which only centres in the mind:</p>
<p class='line'>Why have I stray’d from pleasure and repose,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>425</span></p>
<p class='line'>To seek a good each government bestows?</p>
<p class='line'>In every government, though terrors reign,</p>
<p class='line'>Though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain,</p>
<p class='line'>How small, of all that human hearts endure,</p>
<p class='line'>That part which laws or kings can cause or cure?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>430</span></p>
<p class='line'>Still to ourselves in every place consign’d,</p>
<p class='line'>Our own felicity we make or find:</p>
<p class='line'>With secret course, which no loud storms annoy</p>
<p class='line'>Glides the smooth current of domestic joy.</p>
<p class='line'>The lifted axe, the agonizing wheel,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:x-small'>435</span></p>
<p class='line'>Luke’s iron crown, and Damiens’ bed of steel,</p>
<p class='line'>To men remote from power but rarely known,</p>
<p class='line'>Leave reason, faith, and conscience, all our own.</p>

<p>829. The lower edges of the cloud or mist which the wind lifts.</p>

<p>910. “The calling of the sea is a term used, I believe, chiefly in the

on a windless night, the echo of it rings through the timbers of the old
houses in a haven.” (Tennyson.) A ground-swell is a heavy swell due
to a violent gale. It is often felt for some days afterwards and on
shores which are far distant from the scene of the storm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published in 1842.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='it'>Morte D’Arthur</span> (The Death of Arthur) is a story of King Arthur
and The Round Table, based on the legend entitled <span class='it'>Morte D’Arthur</span>,
which was written by Malory, an English writer of the sixteenth
century. King Arthur was a mythical king of the Britons who was
supposed to have lived and reigned in the sixth century, and to have
united the Britons against the Saxon invaders. According to legend he
established a famous order of knighthood known as The Order of The
Round Table, so called because of the famous round table, presented to
King Arthur by a British king, and capable of seating one hundred and
fifty knights. In the course of time the knights of the Round Table
became corrupt and forgot their vows, and, led by Modred, the king’s
nephew, a number of them rose in rebellion against the king. King
Arthur with those knights who remained loyal to him, drove the army
of Modred step by step back into Cornwall and beyond it into the land
of Lyonnesse, which was said to have extended from Cornwall to the
Scilly Isles, but which has since been submerged by the sea. Here in
this waste land a great battle was fought, in which the knights on both
sides were killed, until at last only King Arthur and his faithful knight
Sir Bedivere remained.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'><a id='chill2'></a>THE PRISONER OF CHILLON.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of <span class='it'>The Prisoner of Chillon</span> is founded on certain events
in the life of Francis Bonnivard, a Swiss patriot, who was imprisoned
in the Fortress of Chillon for six years. Bonnivard was born in 1496.
He belonged to a noble family, and inherited a rich priory near Geneva.
When the republic was attacked in 1519 by Charles III Duke of Savoy,
Bonnivard came to its defence. After many adventures he was taken
prisoner by the Duke in 1530, and consigned to the dungeon of Chillon.
He was liberated in 1536 when the castle fell into the hands of the Swiss
patriots. From this time until his death in 1571 he was prominent
in the affairs of the republic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron wrote this poem in 1816, a few days after visiting Chillon.
At that time he was not familiar with the true facts in the life of
Bonnivard and his story contains numerous details which have no
foundation in reality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle of Chillon is situated on a rock in Lake Geneva, and is
connected with the mainland by a bridge. It was built in 1218, and
served both as a fortress and a prison.</p>

<p>11. Bonnivard was imprisoned for political reasons, not on account
of his religion.</p>

<p>14. <span class='bold'>tenets.</span> Beliefs.</p>

<p>25. Not historically true. Francis Bonnivard was the only one of
his family who was imprisoned in Chillon.</p>

<p>27. <span class='bold'>seven pillars.</span> In reality there are eight, one of which is partly
built into the wall.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>Gothic.</span> A style of architecture introduced during the Middle Ages.
Among other characteristics it was marked by high pointed windows
and clustered pillars.</p>

<p>237. <span class='bold'>scarce conscious what I wist.</span> Scarcely conscious of what I

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First published in 1751.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Elegy is a poem or song expressing the writer’s feelings of sorrow
or mourning. The churchyard referred to in the poem is that of Stoke
Pogis in Buckinghamshire, where Gray’s mother lived during the latter
part of her life. Gray is buried in this churchyard.</p>

<p>9. <span class='bold'>yonder ivy-mantled tower.</span> The tower of the village church
at Stoke <a id='poges'></a>Poges.</p>

<p>13. <span class='bold'>that yew-tree’s shade.</span> It has been suggested that this should
read, “that yew-trees shade,” because the yew is not a large tree. In
that case the meaning would be “those rugged elms that shade the
yew-trees of the churchyard.”</p>

<p>16. <span class='bold'>rude.</span> Lacking refinement, unpolished.</p>

<p>17. <span class='bold'>incense-breathing.</span> Breathing fragrance.</p>

<p>26. <span class='bold'>glebe.</span> Sod, turf.</p>

<p>29. <span class='bold'>Ambition.</span> Ambitious people. Such personification is frequent
throughout the poem.</p>

<p>33. <span class='bold'>The boast of heraldry.</span> The pride of lineage or family descent.
Heraldry was the science that dealt with armorial bearings; and a
family who were versed in heraldry and knew the meaning and history
of their coat-of-arms might be in a position to boast of their lineage.</p>

<p>38. <span class='bold'>trophies.</span> Memorials to commemorate their great deeds.</p>

<p>39. <span class='bold'>fretted vault.</span> The arched ceiling ornamented with fretwork.</p>

<p>41. <span class='bold'>storied urn.</span> A vessel containing the ashes of the dead, and
inscribed with a record of his virtues.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>animated bust.</span> A life-like image.</p>

<p>43. <span class='bold'>provoke.</span> Call forth.</p>

<p>41-44. What is the use of such trophies? they cannot bring the
dead back to life, and neither honour nor flattery can appeal to those
who are dead.</p>

<p>46. <span class='bold'>pregnant with celestial fire.</span> Filled with the poetic spirit.</p>

<p>48. <span class='bold'>the living lyre.</span> The musical instrument seeming almost as if it
had life.</p>

<p>51. Their poetic fervour (rage) was repressed by poverty.</p>

<p>52. <span class='bold'>the genial current of their soul.</span> The flow of their finer
feelings and emotions.</p>

<p>58. <span class='bold'>The little tyrant of his fields.</span> The landowner who attempted
to tyrannize over him.</p>

<p>60. <span class='bold'>guiltless of his country’s blood.</span> The general opinion held of
Cromwell in the eighteenth century was that he was a cruel tyrant who
was “guilty of his country’s blood.” The village Cromwell is guiltless
because he has had no opportunity to act the part of a real Cromwell.</p>

<p>61. <span class='bold'>senates.</span> Assemblies.</p>

<p>64. In the gratitude of the nation they saw the results of their own
efforts.</p>

<p>65-72. If their humble lot prevented the development of their best
qualities, it also limited their opportunity for doing wrong. It
prevented them from becoming tyrannical, from telling what is false,
from having to conceal their feelings of shame, and from accepting the
flattery which poets too often bestow upon their proud and wealthy
patrons.</p>

<p>70. <span class='bold'>ingenuous.</span> Without artifice, frank, open-hearted.</p>

<p>73. This line is adjectival to the pronoun <span class='it'>they</span> implied in <span class='it'>their</span>.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>madding.</span> Maddening, distracting.</p>

<p>76. <span class='bold'>tenour.</span> Course.</p>

<p>78. <span class='bold'>still.</span> Always, in all cases.</p>

<p>81. <span class='bold'>unlettered.</span> Uneducated.</p>

<p>87. <span class='bold'>the warm precincts of the cheerful day.</span> The warm bright
earth.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>precincts.</span> Limits, boundaries.</p>

<p>88. <span class='bold'>nor cast.</span> Without casting.</p>

<p>90. <span class='bold'>pious drops.</span> Tears which are due to the dying (Lat. <span class='it'>pius</span>,
dutiful). It soothes the dying to know that some-one is weeping for
their loss.</p>

<p>91. Even the dead seem to cry out for remembrance.</p>

<p>93. <span class='bold'>thee.</span> The poet is addressing himself.</p>

<p>94. <span class='bold'>artless.</span> Simple, without deceit.</p>

<p>97. <span class='bold'>Haply.</span> Perhaps. <span class='bold'>Swain.</span> Country man, rustic.</p>

<p>105. <span class='bold'>smiling.</span> Modifies <span class='it'>he</span>, l. 106.</p>

<p>108. <span class='bold'>Or .&nbsp;. or.</span> Either .&nbsp;. or, a poetical form.</p>

<p>123. <span class='bold'>Science.</span> Knowledge, in the wide sense of the word.</p>

<p>126-8. His merits and his weaknesses are both alike left in the hands
of God.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>dread abode.</span> Explained by the last line, which is in apposition.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>trembling.</span> With fear or anxiety.</p>

them are forgotten in the long course of life.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>sunshine and snow.</span> With complexion rosy and white. Notice
how this metaphor is continued through lines 3 and 4.</p>

<p>12. Her face was so expressive that it conveyed almost as much as

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written and published in 1820.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skylark is a European bird, and is not found in America. It
makes its nest on the ground but rises high in the air, sometimes
beyond the point of vision, to sing. The Canadian Horned Lark, which
is common in our fields in early spring, sometimes also sings high in the
air above its nest.</p>

<p>12. <span class='bold'>sunken sun.</span> The sun is still below the horizon.</p>

<p>15. <span class='bold'>unbodied joy.</span> The lark is so high in the air that it no longer
appears to him as a bird; but hearing its song he thinks of it only as
an ethereal source of joy.</p>

<p>22-25. The rays of light from the morning star are so keen that even
when it has almost vanished in the light of the clear dawn we feel that
the star is there. So even after the bird has vanished from sight, we
know from the “arrows” of song that it is there.</p>

<p>36-7. He represents the poet as absorbed in his own bright fancies,
and in this way hidden from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>47. <span class='bold'>a dell of dew.</span> A little dewy valley or hollow.</p>

<p>49. <span class='bold'>aerial hue.</span> Literally, the colour of the air. The glowworm of
Britain is said to emit a bluish light.</p>

<p>55. <span class='bold'>heavy-wingéd thieves.</span> The winds made heavy by the perfume.</p>

<p>56. <span class='bold'>vernal.</span> Belonging to the Spring.</p>

<p>57. <span class='bold'>twinkling.</span> Sparkling with the rain upon it.</p>

<p>61. <span class='bold'>sprite.</span> Spirit.</p>

<p>66. <span class='bold'>Chorus hymeneal.</span> A marriage song. Hymen was the God of
marriage.</p>

<p>77. <span class='bold'>Languor.</span> A feeling of weakness or exhaustion.</p>

<p>80. <span class='bold'>sad satiety.</span> Just as one may become satiated with an excess of
sweet things, so the poet speaks of even Love, when enjoyed to the full,
as bringing with it a feeling of sadness.</p>

<p>82-5. Death is always bringing sorrow into our lives, so that under its
shadow we can never be quite happy. But perhaps the skylark knows
more about what Death really is, and sees that it is a good thing.</p>

<p>91-5. But even if we had no sadness of any kind in our lives, we
could not feel as keen a joy as the song of the skylark expresses.</p>

<p>103. <span class='bold'>harmonious madness.</span> His rapture would find expression in an
ecstasy of song.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First published in 1859. When the <span class='it'>Idylls of the King</span> appeared in
their final form, in 1888, the story of <span class='it'>Enid</span> was divided into two parts,
the first part being entitled <span class='it'>The Marriage of Geraint</span>, the second,
<span class='it'>Geraint and Enid</span>. The poem here given includes only the part of <span class='it'>Enid</span>
which is now known as <span class='it'>The Marriage of Geraint</span>. Tennyson’s story of
<span class='it'>Enid</span> is based upon the prose version of the story, as it appears in the
<span class='it'>Mabinogion</span>, a famous collection of Welsh fairy stories and legends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before beginning the study of the poem read the introductory note to
<span class='it'>Morte D’Arthur</span>.</p>

<p>24-5. The Queen, Guinevere, was the daughter of Leodogran, a
tributary king. When Leodogran had given his consent to the marriage
of his daughter Guinevere to Arthur, the king sent Lancelot, his truest
and bravest knight, to bring Guinevere to the court. Guinevere, not
having yet seen the king, fell in love with Lancelot, and her love was
returned. This secret love was continued, and under its influence,
little by little, the ideals of the knights were lowered. The incidents
in the story of <span class='it'>Enid</span> are supposed to have taken place shortly after the
marriage of Arthur and Guinevere.</p>

<p>35. <span class='bold'>caitiff.</span> Base, mean.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'><a id='dream2'></a>THE DAY DREAM.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <span class='it'>The Day Dream</span> Tennyson has elaborated in poetical form a series
of scenes from the well-known fairy tale of <span class='it'>The Sleeping Beauty</span> or <span class='it'>Briar
Rose</span>. In the fairy story, Briar Rose is a beautiful princess who was
fated to fall asleep in her fifteenth year and remain sleeping for a
hundred years. When the princess is overtaken by her long sleep,
everything in the castle falls under the same spell. An impenetrable
hedge of briars grows up about the castle grounds, and all who strive to
force an entrance perish in the attempt. At length, when the hundred
years have passed, comes a splendid prince, who hears from an old man
the story of the mysterious castle and the sleeping princess. When
he reaches the hedge he passes easily through, for the briars have
turned to flowers. At the very moment when he finds the princess, the
hundred years are completed, and as he kisses her she opens her eyes
once more. When the princess wakes, the whole castle revives, and
life goes on again as it did a hundred years before. The story ends with
the marriage of Briar Rose and the prince.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairy tale in its original form was probably suggested by the
changing seasons. In Winter the earth, the fairy princess, begins her
long sleep. In the Springtime comes the sun, the fairy prince, and at
the touch of his kiss the earth awakes to new life and beauty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the poem as here given, <span class='it'>The Prologue</span>, <span class='it'>L’Envoi</span> and <span class='it'>The
Epilogue</span> are omitted. In <span class='it'>The Prologue</span> the poet tells his companion,
Lady Flora, that the sight of her beauty as she lay asleep had called to
his mind an image of The Sleeping Beauty, and that in his “day
dream” he had recalled the old legend. And so as she works at her
embroidery he bids her listen to the story. <span class='it'>L’Envoi</span> and <span class='it'>The Epilogue</span>,
written also in a light and fanciful vein, contain the poet’s comments
on the story.</p>

<p>61. <span class='bold'>tranced.</span> See <span class='it'>Enoch Arden</span>, line 793, and note.</p>

filled with love, and the day seems to be brighter because of her beauty.</p>

<p>76. <span class='bold'>charmed.</span> Under a spell.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='sc'>The Arrival.</span></p>

<p>81-4. It seems as if when precious things have remained long hidden,
they come forth of their own accord to greet those who seek them; for
when Fate has decreed that some hidden work shall be revealed, Love
follows up the decree and makes the discovery.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>in sequel.</span> Following.</p>

<p>86. <span class='bold'>on the rocks.</span> Against the dull rocks.</p>

moon is floating like a boat upon the sea.</p>

<p>167. <span class='bold'>rapt.</span> Carried along, moved forward.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='sc'>Moral.</span></p>

<p>177-84. A thing that is beautiful in itself, as this story is, needs no
moral. “Beauty is its own excuse for being.”</p>

<p>185-92. In all things in Nature we can find a meaning if we choose.
So with this story, as with other forms of art, it is possible to read into
it different meanings.</p>

men long for the warmth and colour of the South.</p>

<p>10. <span class='bold'>of just and old renown.</span> England has long been renowned for her
free institutions, and justly so.</p>

<p>11-2. British freedom has been gained gradually, each new step
growing out of events that have gone before. The Magna Charta, for
example, was a precedent for the Petition of Right.</p>

<p>13. Those who seek to create dissension seldom succeed in bringing
about an actual struggle.</p>

<p>15. A diffusive thought is one which readily spreads or circulates
from mind to mind.</p>

<p>16. <span class='bold'>Hath time and space.</span> Because Great Britain in itself is a small
country.</p>

<p>17-26. If the time should ever come when any body of men should
band themselves together to persecute those who do not agree with
them, and when a man may not “speak the thing he will,” then, no
matter how powerful or wealthy Britain may become, I will leave this
country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published in 1764.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldsmith dedicated <span class='it'>The Traveller</span> to his brother Henry, who was a
country curate in Lissoy, a village in Ireland. The substance of the
poem is briefly summed up by Macaulay as follows:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No philosophical poem, ancient or modern, has a plan so noble and at the same
time so simple. An English wanderer, seated on a crag among the Alps, near the
point where three great countries meet, looks down on the boundless prospect,
reviews his long pilgrimage, recalls the variety of scenery, of climate, of government,
of religion, of national character, which he has observed, and comes to the conclusion,
just or unjust, that our happiness depends little on political institutions, and much on
the temper and regulation of the mind.”</p>

<p>23. <span class='bold'>me.</span> Object of <span class='it'>leads</span>.</p>

<p>27-8. These two lines explain how the fleeting good mocks him. His
idea of what will bring him happiness is always changing. When one
thing is attained he finds no real satisfaction in it, but is constantly
looking forward to some new thing which he thinks may bring him
happiness.</p>

<p>32. <span class='bold'>pensive.</span> Meditative.</p>

<p>34. <span class='bold'>a hundred realms.</span> Exaggeration for effect.</p>

poem.</p>

labour.</p>

human forms were chiselled.</p>

<p>142. <span class='bold'>unmann’d.</span> Without men.</p>

<p>143-4. Certain diseases were supposed to arise from a superabundance
(plethora) of blood. So ills arose out of the prosperity of Italy.</p>

no real results. It could not save Italy.</p>

<p>319. <span class='bold'>lawns.</span> Stretches of meadow land.</p>

the Indus. It was the eastern boundary of the kingdom of Alexander
the Great.</p>

<p>323-4. Extremes are not found in the climate, but only in the minds
of the people.</p>

<p>325. They are controlled by reason; but their aims are daring, and
hence great in an unusual way. The aims of men in other countries
may be great, but they follow the regular lines of thought and there is
nothing daring or irregular about them.</p>

<p>330. <span class='bold'>By forms unfashion’d.</span> They do not follow fixed or conventional

<p>346. <span class='bold'>round her shore.</span> Throughout the country.</p>

<p>347-8. Note the metaphor in these lines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that when the wheels of a carriage are subjected to too
great friction they either refuse to turn, or else catch fire from the over-heating
of the axle. So in society, this internal struggle and ferment
(ll. 344-6) must result in a breakdown in the machinery of government

of the Wilkes’ agitations in Britain.</p>

<p>351. <span class='bold'>Fictitious.</span> Artificial.</p>

<p>357. <span class='bold'>noble stems.</span> The heads of noble families.</p>

<p>369. <span class='bold'>the changeful clime.</span> Of Britain.</p>

extremes, it will bring greater security.</p>

<p>373-6. He means to say that if any class of people is to be allowed
too great privileges it will affect the rights of others.</p>

the Whig government then in power.</p>

<p>383. <span class='bold'>a factious band.</span> A group of politicians seeking to further their
personal interests by agitation and dissension.</p>

<p>391-2. Partly from motives of patriotism, partly from fear of the
evils threatening my country, I appeal to the sovereign to protect it
against these petty political tyrants.</p>

<p>393. <span class='bold'>baleful.</span> Evil, pernicious.</p>

<p>395. The sovereign is here regarded as the fountain-head or source
of honour.</p>

<p>396. <span class='bold'>Gave wealth to sway.</span> Gave wealth the power to sway.</p>

<p>398. The wealth (useless ore) of the landowners was used to buy up
the small holdings, and the labourers (useful sons) were turned adrift
and forced to emigrate.</p>

<p>399. Britain’s successes in war have only helped to hasten destruction
by bringing into existence a wealthy class of men.</p>

<p>401-2. See note on line 398 above.</p>

<p>403-4. The rich man lives at his ease on estates where villages once
stood.</p>

<p>407. <span class='bold'>decayed.</span> Worn out, on the decline.</p>

Erie.</p>

<p>417. <span class='bold'>giddy.</span> Whirling.</p>

<p>418. <span class='bold'>distressful.</span> Causing distress.</p>

<p>421. Looks towards England.</p>

<p>422. The feelings of the exile are the same as those of the poet.</p>

<p>423-38. Lines 361-422 have been in the nature of a digression, and
the poet now returns to his original subject as presented in the first
hundred lines of the poem. He has come to the conclusion that happiness
does not depend upon external conditions, but upon the individual
himself; and this conclusion is summed up in lines 431-2.</p>

<p>425. Why have I tried to find the source of happiness in the government
rather than in the mind, which is the centre of pleasure and repose?</p>

<p>431. <span class='it'>Consigned</span> modifies <span class='it'>felicity</span>. We are entrusted with the making
of our own happiness.</p>

<p>433-4. The joy which any man feels in his life from day to day comes
from his own innermost feelings, and external events cannot disturb it.</p>

<p>435-8. Even though a man be put to torture, it cannot rob him of
the truest sources of happiness in his life—reason, faith and conscience.</p>

<p>434. <span class='bold'>The lifted axe.</span> The executioner’s axe.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>the agonizing wheel.</span> An instrument of torture causing extreme
agony. The victim was fastened to a wheel or a cross, and his legs were
broken with an iron bar.</p>

<p>436. <span class='bold'>Luke’s iron crown.</span> In 1513 two brothers, George and Luke
Dosa, were taken prisoners in a rebellion. George (not Luke) Dosa was
put to death by having a red hot crown placed on his head, in mockery
of his desire to become king.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>Damiens’ bed of steel.</span> In 1757 Damiens, an insane fanatic, attempted
to kill Louis XV, King of France. He was bound upon an iron bed
and subjected to terrible tortures.</p>

<p>437. These tortures are rarely known to men who are not engaged
in public affairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written on the occasion of a voyage from England to Italy in 1838.
As the vessel passes the south-west coast of Portugal and Spain, Cape
St. Vincent, Cadiz and Trafalgar are seen in turn, and as darkness is
coming on, Gibraltar rises dimly in the distance. The poem expresses
Browning’s feelings as he calls to memory the great victories of England
that are connected with these historic scenes.</p>

<p>1. <span class='bold'>Cape St. Vincent.</span> A cape at the south-east extremity of Portugal.
In 1709 Admiral Jervis with a British fleet of fifteen vessels, defeated
a Spanish fleet of twenty-seven vessels.</p>

<p>2. <span class='bold'>reeking.</span> We often speak of blood as reeking, that is, steaming
(<span class='it'>Ger. rauchen</span>, to smoke). So here the sunset is spoken of also as
reeking because it is red like blood.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>Cadiz Bay.</span> Off the south-west coast of Spain. Cadiz was sacked
by the English fleet under Essex in 1596.</p>

<p>3. <span class='bold'>Bluish.</span> The land was bluish when seen in the distance.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>full in face.</span> Directly ahead of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>Trafalgar.</span> Cape Trafalgar, on the south-west coast of Spain. At
Trafalgar in 1805 Nelson defeated the combined fleets of France and
Spain.</p>

<p>4. <span class='bold'>dimmest north-east distance.</span> After the vessel passed Trafalgar
and turned to enter the straits, the rock of Gibraltar was seen dimly to
the north-east. Consult a good map or atlas.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>dawned.</span> Appeared dimly on the horizon.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>Gibraltar.</span> The fortress of Gibraltar came into the hands of the
English in 1704. It was, later in the century, successfully defended
against a number of attacks.</p>

<p>5. <span class='bold'>Here and here.</span> In the battles he has mentioned.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>say.</span> The subject of <span class='it'>say</span> is the noun clause following.</p>

<p>5-6. Anyone who turns as I do to praise God for England’s victories
and to pray for her continued greatness, cannot but ask himself the
question, “How can I help England in return for what she has done for
me?”</p>

<p>7. <span class='bold'>Jove’s planet.</span> The planet Jupiter. Perhaps the sight of “Jove’s
planet” suggests to the poet England’s continued strength and glory.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>over Africa.</span> To the south-east. Possibly the vessel has not yet
passed Gibraltar which he had only seen dimly in the distance as night
came on.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'><a id='patr'></a>THE PATRIOT.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='it'>The Patriot</span> tells the story of a man who has come into power amid
the acclamations of the crowd as the hero of the people. But popular
favour is fickle, and in one short year he is reviled and led to execution.
He suffers, not because he has failed in his duty, but simply because he
has failed to please the fickle crowd. To those who have read history
the sub-title <span class='sc'>An Old Story</span> will need no further explanation.</p>

<p>2. <span class='bold'>myrtle.</span> The leaves of the myrtle were used to make wreaths for
those who won triumphs in the arts of peace. It is an emblem of peace
and joy.</p>

<p>6. <span class='bold'>a mist.</span> Of course this is not to be taken literally. It is a poetic
way of saying that the air is filled with the sound of bells.</p>

<p>8-10. If I had objected that I did not like noise but that I wished
them to give me the sun from out the sky they would have been quite
willing to give me not only the sun but anything else they had.</p>

<p>17. <span class='bold'>a palsied few.</span> Too feeble to follow the crowd.</p>

<p>20. <span class='bold'>Shambles’ Gate.</span> A fictitious name for the place of execution.
Shambles are the places where animals are slaughtered or where butchers’
meat is sold. Hence, as here, a place of butchery.</p>

<p>25. <span class='bold'>my year’s misdeeds.</span> What the rabble consider as misdeeds.</p>

<p>27. The man who has been honoured by the world, even if he drops
dead in the midst of his triumph, has been paid, and perhaps more than
paid, for his good deeds, and if men’s rewards and punishments are
balanced up, in the next world, such a man may find that he is in God’s
debt. But the speaker, “The Patriot,” is suffering so much injustice
and wrong that he is sure that some balance of reward will be due him
in the next world.</p>

<p>1. <span class='bold'>The quiet-coloured end of evening.</span> The late twilight when the
bright colours have faded from the sky.</p>

<p>7. <span class='bold'>a city.</span> The poet had in mind probably the Campagna,—the level
stretch of country outside the city of Rome. This district was once
very thickly populated.</p>

<p>9. Supply the conjunctive pronoun, <span class='it'>that</span> or <span class='it'>which</span>.</p>

<p>13. Notice that throughout the poem, the description of the scenery
as it now appears, is alternated with the pictures of its former splendour.</p>

<p>15-8. If there had been trees it would have been an easy matter
to distinguish certain slopes from others by the single trees or groups of
trees growing on them. Now these slopes are separated only by streams
and they take their names from the names of these streams which flow
through the valleys.</p>

<p>19. <span class='bold'>daring.</span> Because it rose so high.</p>

cucumber. <span class='bold'>overscored.</span> By the stems of the vines, which form lines
on the wall.</p>

patching. covering up the holes; or, perhaps, forming patches on the
walls. <span class='bold'>winks.</span> When moved by the breeze.</p>

<p>45. <span class='bold'>burning.</span> Because they were made of gold.</p>

<p>47. <span class='bold'>minions.</span> Favourites.</p>

<p>50-2. Smiles because she is leaving the flocks to return in peace to
their folds.</p>

<p>55. <span class='bold'>yellow hair.</span> A suggestion that she belonged to a northern race.</p>

<p>57. <span class='bold'>caught soul.</span> They were inspired to do their best by seeing the
king and courtiers watching from the tower.</p>

<p>63-4. <span class='bold'>the glades’ colonnades.</span> The rows of columns in the valleys.</p>

<p>65. <span class='bold'>causeys.</span> Causeways. A causeway is a raised road passing over
wet or marshy ground.</p>

<p>79. He appeals to the feelings of his readers, who are moved by the
same passions now as in the past.</p>

<p>80-4. These ruins are Earth’s returns, the only result of centuries of
folly, noise and sin. In contrast with this is Love, which endures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem appears in Byron’s <span class='it'>Don Juan</span>. It is supposed to be sung
by a wandering Greek minstrel during the marriage feast of the hero
and heroine of the story; but it is a direct expression of Byron’s own
feelings on the subject of Greek freedom.</p>

<p>2. <span class='bold'>Sappho.</span> A lyric poetess who was born on the island of Lesbos
about 625 B.C.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>burning.</span> In reference to the passion in her poems and songs.</p>

<p>4. According to myth, Leda, who had supplanted Juno in the affections
of Jupiter, was forced to flee from heaven to escape the wrath of
Juno. Neptune took pity on her and raised the Island of Delos out of
the sea in order to afford her a shelter. Here Phoebus and Diana, the
twin children of Jupiter and Leda, were born.</p>

<p>7. <span class='bold'>The Scian and the Teian muse.</span> The island of Chios (Scio) was
said to be the birthplace of Homer, and the town of Teos, in Asia Minor,
was the birthplace of the poet Anacreon.</p>

<p>11. <span class='bold'>farther west.</span> In America.</p>

<p>12. In Greek mythology the “Islands of the Blest” were situated
somewhere far in the western ocean.</p>

<p>13. Mount Pentelicus and Mount Parnes overlook the plain of
Marathon, where in 490 B.C. a great battle was fought between the
Persians under Darius, and the Greeks, led by Miltiades.</p>

<p>21. Ten years after the battle of Marathon, Xerxes, the son of
Darius, invaded Greece with a vast army. The Persian fleet was defeated
at Salamis, by the Greeks under Themistocles. Xerxes watched
the progress of the fight from the mainland.</p>

<p>31. <span class='bold'>in the dearth of fame.</span> Though the Greeks are no longer famed
for their poets.</p>

<p>32. <span class='bold'>a fetter’d race.</span> Since 1715 Greece had been in the hands of the
Turks. The War of Independence which began in 1821, resulted in the
establishment of the Greek kingdom in 1832.</p>

<p>37-8. <span class='bold'>we.</span> Italicized to bring out the contrast with <span class='it'>fathers</span>.</p>

<p>40-2. A reference to the battle of Thermopylae (470, B.C.) in which
Leonidas with 300 Spartans and several hundred auxiliaries held the
whole Persian army in check.</p>

<p>43. He has called upon the dead heroes of Greece to return (ll. 39-42);
and now he listens for a reply.</p>

<p>49. <span class='bold'>In vain.</span> It is in vain that we look for even one living hero to
arise to lead the Greeks.</p>

<p>50-2. Samos, Chios, and other islands were famous for their wines.</p>

<p>53-4. <span class='bold'>Bacchanal.</span> A follower of Bacchus, the god of wine.</p>

<p>55-6. The Pyrrhic dance was so named from Pyrrhichus, who
invented it. The Pyrrhic phalanx derives its name from Pyrrhus, king
of Epirus. A phalanx is a serried formation of troops.</p>

<p>59. The alphabet is said to have been introduced into Greece by
Cadmus, a Phœnician, who lived about 1450, B.C.</p>

<p>63-5. Polycrates, who ruled over the Island of Samos, was the
patron of Anacreon. <span class='it'>Tyrant</span> in the Greek sense meant simply “ruler”
or “master,” and as here used the word does not imply harshness or
cruelty.</p>

<p>68. <span class='bold'>Chersonese.</span> The word literally means a peninsula. Here it
refers to the Tauric Chersonnesus, the modern Crimea.</p>

<p>72. That is, he bound the Greeks together to resist their enemies.</p>

<p>74. <span class='bold'>Suli.</span> A mountainous district inhabited by a mixed Greek and
Albanian people.</p>

beginning of the line.</p>

<p>79. <span class='bold'>the Franks.</span> The French.</p>

<p>80. Louis XVIII was at this time king of France. Perhaps Byron
is referring to Napoleon, who entered into alliance with the Turks.</p>

<p>89. <span class='bold'>mine own.</span> Mine own eyes.</p>

<p>91. <span class='bold'>Sunium.</span> The southern promontory of Attica.</p>

<p>1-7. The nautilus is a species of shell-fish. The shell is spiral, and
is divided into chambers or cavities. The animal occupies only the
outer cavity. The others are filled with gas. The belief once existed
that the nautilus was furnished with a membrane which served as a
sail. The root meaning of the word <span class='it'>nautilus</span> is “a ship.” This old
belief is, however, only a poetic fancy. The nautilus creeps along the
bottom of the sea, and does not come to the surface to swim or sail.</p>

<p>5. <span class='bold'>the Siren.</span> The Sirens were sea-nymphs, who by their entrancing
music fascinated those who sailed along their shores, and drew them on
to their destruction.</p>

<p>13. The shell is broken so that the separate cells are seen.</p>

<p>14. <span class='bold'>irised ceiling.</span> The walls of the cell, tinted like the rainbow.</p>
